There are many procedures that need to be performed related to data. Without digital technology it might cause human error which will lead to issues in higher cost and will create a lot of delay in the procurement process. To improve procurement performance, selecting the right technologies that will create performance impact is quite a challenging task for the company. This study aims to examine the impact of digital technology adoption on procurement performance and to examine the mechanism through which digital technologies impact procurement performance. Target groups are medium and large manufacturing companies in the Eastern economic corridor, Thailand. In research findings, there is data supporting our hypotheses that digital technology adoption in procurement has a positive impact on procurement performance in cost and cycle time reduction. As a result of the moderation effect, reducing human errors, data availability and responsiveness moderated the positive impact between technology adoption and procurement cost reduction. The effect between technology adoption and procurement cycle time reduction has positively been mediated by reducing human errors and data availability. However, responsiveness rejected the hypothesis that mediates the relationship between technology adoption and procurement cycle time reduction. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Digital technology adoption; Digital transformation; e-Procurement; Procurement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176565936"

This article explores the spillover effects among green technology innovation (GTI), oil prices (OP), clean energy (CE), sustainable development (SD), and economic cycles (EC) with the time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) connectedness method. The empirical results demonstrate that, in static analysis, the short-term connectedness is significantly stronger than that in the long term. SD serves as the main transmitter, while EC acts as the primary receiver. Furthermore, dynamic analysis suggests that spillover effects fluctuate with time and frequency. Finally, the net direction and net pairwise connectedness reveal that GTI is favorable for mitigating OP shocks and accelerating EC in the long term, while it is driven by CE and SD in the short term. The contribution of this paper lies in its incorporation of GTI, energy markets, economic cycles, and SD into a unified framework, and its detailed analysis of the channels of influence. Also, based on a time-frequency domain perspective, the paper dynamically examines the different performances of specific markets in the short or long term. Finally, the paper proposes some policy recommendations, including the strengthening of green technology innovation and the acceleration of energy transition. © 2024","Energy market; Green technology innovation; Sustainable development; Time-frequency dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189659138"

As employees play a crucial role in maintaining organizational cybersecurity, it is essential to understand the factors that influence their cybersecurity behavior. This study investigates the impact of work overload on employee cybersecurity behavior, exploring the sequential mediating effects of psychological contract breach and burnout, as well as the moderating role of self-efficacy in AI learning. Drawing upon the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, and Social Cognitive Theory, we propose a moderated mediation model to elucidate the complex relationships among these variables. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a three-wave survey study involving 363 employees from various sectors in South Korea. Data was collected using an internet-based survey platform, and the study employed stratified random sampling to reduce sampling bias. Results from structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses revealed that work overload indirectly impacts cybersecurity behavior through the sequential mediation of psychological contract breach and burnout. Furthermore, self-efficacy in AI learning such as ChatGPT was found to moderate the relationship between work overload and psychological contract breach, acting as a buffer to mitigate the negative effects of work overload. This study contributes to the existing literature by addressing several research gaps. First, it provides a comprehensive examination of the impact of work overload on employee cybersecurity behavior. Second, it investigates the underlying psychological processes (i.e., psychological contract breach and burnout) that explain the relationship between work overload and cybersecurity behavior. Third, it explores the moderating role of self-efficacy in AI learning such as ChatGPT, an understudied factor in the context of work overload and cybersecurity behavior. © 2024","Burnout; Cybersecurity behavior; Psychological contract breach; Self-efficacy in artificial intelligence learning; Work overload","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189514189"

This study presents a novel perspective by examining the dynamic impact of geothermal energy on GDP and GHG emissions in both developing and developed countries from 2000 to 2019. By employing Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) estimations, our study demonstrates a negative impact of geothermal energy on short-run GDP but also proves to be a positive contributor to long-run GDP, particularly in developed countries. Additionally, our study unveils a noteworthy discovery that geothermal energy has a positive effect on GHG levels in both country groups over the long run, although the coefficient is lower in developed countries. These findings are robust and confirmed through Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) techniques. The ARDL findings are justified by the Dumitrescu Hurlin (D-H) causality model, indicating the existence of unidirectional causality from GHG emissions to geothermal energy. Based on this empirical evidence, we suggest policymakers support geothermal energy projects through streamlined processes, incentives, and ongoing policy reviews for environmental sustainability and economic growth. © 2024 The Author(s)","ARDL; Economic growth; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Panel causality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188694291"

We focus on the unique ontology of digital transformation and delineate it from neighboring concepts. Our contention is that, despite its volume, current research remains unclear about how the digital transformation of organizations differs from their IT-enabled transformation. We advocate definitional precision to foster knowledge accumulation and to enable scholars to pursue important research questions that are unique to digital transformation. Our perspective, grounded in the notion of digital resources, defines digital transformation as the metamorphosis of an IT-enabled organization into a digital organization – one with a specific digital architecture and design principles. A key departure from previous conceptualization is that we characterize digital transformation as a change in digital technology architecture rather than a change from digital technology use. Our paper achieves the following: describes the constructs underpinning this formulation, digital resources and digital organization; justifies their use; and describes what research directions the new perspective promotes. With sound definitions of key constructs, Information Systems scholars have the unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in digital “x” research, making our discipline the reference point for the burgeoning “digital research” literature in related business fields. © 2024 The Authors","Digital ontology; Digital organization; Digital resources; Digital transformation; IT-enabled transformation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189654405"

The Study 1 uses Instagram data collected using the Apify tool, an Instagram Scraper, for four leading UPI brands in India over eight months. Linear regression was performed on the dataset with likes as the dependent variable and content vividness, content appeal, and content interactivity as the independent variables. The qualitative Study 2, based on semi structured interviews of Instagram users who make UPI payments, corroborates Study 1, and provides a richer, more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon. For UPI brands, we found that entertaining and remunerative appeals are more effective than other content appeals in generating likes on Instagram. This research does not find a positive effect of relational appeal over information appeal on the number of likes, indicating that content with relational appeal is not very effective for UPI brands. Further, this study suggests interesting findings about the role of interactivity and vividness in driving consumer engagement on social media platforms.

The use of these platforms has been associated with a positive impact on economic growth and people’s welfare. They allow for convenient, secure, and efficient transaction and are the crucial element of e-commerce. In this paper, we analyse the effect of mobile network coverage on adoption of financial technologies and financial inclusion using a survey data of 12,735 individuals from nine sub-Saharan African countries conducted in 2017. By combining survey data with information on the proximity of mobile network towers, we estimate a two-stage model. In the first stage, consumers decide to adopt a technology device, and in the second stage, they decide whether to use digital financial services or not. Results show a significant and positive relationship between network coverage and adoption of digital financial services. Considering that the whole population lives within 2 km radius from the LTE tower, financial inclusion would increase by 6% in Mozambique and 3% in Ghana, Rwanda and Senegal. In Tanzania, where mobile money is the common financial service, investment in GSM and UMTS would have a larger impact on financial inclusion than LTE. These results show that digital financial technologies such as mobile money, mobile banking and e-wallet, that do not necessarily require consumers to be connected to the Internet have a greater impact on financial inclusion in East African countries, where financial service innovations are mobile led.

It is currently used in a wide range of industries, from industrial automation and augmented reality, to smart cities and connected vehicles, where low latency, data privacy, and real-time processing are critical requirements. The latency of accessing applications in edge computing must be consistently below a threshold of a few tens of milliseconds to maintain an acceptable experience for end-users. However, the latency between users and applications can vary considerably depending on the network load and mode of wireless access. An application provider must be able to guarantee that requests are served in a timely manner by their application instances hosted in the edge despite such latency variations. This article focuses on the placement and traffic allocation problem faced by application providers in determining where to place application instances on edge nodes such that requests are served within a certain deadline. It proposes novel formulations based on robust optimization to provide optimal plans that protect against latency variations in a configurable number of network links. The robust formulations are based on two different types of polyhedral uncertainty sets that offer different levels of protection against variations in latency. Extensive simulations show that our robust models are able to keep the number of chosen edge nodes low while reducing the number of latency violations as compared to a deterministic optimization model that only considers the average latency of network links. © 2024 The Authors","Application placement; Edge computing; Robust optimization; Telecommunication networks; Uncertainty in network latency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186537354"

Among other concepts, such as transparency and accountability, fairness has become crucial in AI recruitment debates due to the potential reproduction of bias and discrimination that can disproportionately affect certain vulnerable groups. However, the ideals and ambitions of fairness may signify different meanings to various stakeholders. Conceptualizing fairness is critical because it may provide a clear benchmark for evaluating and mitigating biases, ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate existing imbalances and promote, in this case, equitable opportunities for all candidates in the job market. To this end, in this article, we conduct a scoping literature review on fairness in AI applications for recruitment and selection purposes, with special emphasis on its definition, categorization, and practical implementation. We start by explaining how AI applications have been increasingly used in the hiring process, especially to increase the efficiency of the HR team. We then move to the limitations of this technological innovation, which is known to be at high risk of privacy violations and social discrimination. Against this backdrop, we focus on defining and operationalizing fairness in AI applications for recruitment and selection purposes through cross-disciplinary lenses. Although the applicable legal frameworks and some research currently address the issue piecemeal, we observe and welcome the emergence of some cross-disciplinary efforts aimed at tackling this multifaceted challenge. We conclude the article with some brief recommendations to guide and shape future research and action on the fairness of AI applications in the hiring process for the better. © 2024","Artificial intelligence; Data protection; Discrimination; Fairness; Hiring; Recruitment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189749987"

This study provides long-term projections for wind power generation derived from a 2 MW wind turbine for the upcoming year and subsequent years utilizing the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Classification And Regression Tree (CART), Linear Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) techniques. The research is carried out in two distinct phases. During Phase 1 all considered predictive methods are compared. The research demonstrates that the MARS algorithm is a robust and efficient predictor for wind-based power generation, exhibiting strong competitiveness in its performance. During Phase 2, the MARS algorithm is employed to forecast the future 30-year wind power generation capacity lifespan hourly for nine cities in Texas, USA. It is projected that El Paso and Dallas will witness a mean rise of 8.6% in wind power capacity over three decades, while the remaining seven cities are anticipated to have an average decline of 7.7%. Hence, it is imperative to do a comprehensive and extended evaluation employing the MARS technique compared to ANN, CART, LR and RF before installing a wind turbine.

The question of how to enhance the business environment to facilitate and encourage firm digital transformation emerges as a crucial area of inquiry. To explore the relationship between city-level business environment and firm digital transformation, we conducted configuration analysis based on a sample of 3088 manufacturing firms across 240 Chinese cities in year 2022. Based on results, we identified three distinct business environments, consisting of both detrimental and favorable factors, that can promote firm digital transformation. Thereinto, limited public resources, a shortage of human resources, and an underdeveloped market environment work that prompt firms' motivation of digital transformation, since the negative consequences stemming from those limitations can be mitigated by digital transformation. Meanwhile, a conducive innovation environment, significant financial development, a favorable legal environment, and a supportive political environment serve as advantageous factors that amplify firms' willingness to embrace digital transformation, since they mitigate costs and risks associated with digital transformation.

BSS is an avenue for swapping a worn-out EV battery for a pre-charged one, eliminating the long charging times of batteries. However, consumer adoption of BSS is overlooked, lacking empirical support. BSS is encouraged as it makes clean ‘fuel’ readily available for EV use. Consumer willingness to patronize BSS is pivotal to EV usage, sustainable transport, and pollution mitigation. Consequently, the innovation diffusion theory is extended with attitude, perceived risk, green self-identity, and task-technology fit to investigate consumer willingness to use BSS. Utilizing a partial least squares-structural equation model (PLS-SEM), 618 responses were analyzed. The outcome revealed that relative advantage, compatibility, attitude, green self-identity, and task-technology fit positively impacted willingness to use BSS. Perceived risk had a significant adverse effect on willingness to use BSS. Attitude mediated the impact of relative advantage and task-technology fit. Also, perceived risk negatively affected attitude. Further, ANOVA analysis confirmed the impact of consumer demography on the willingness to use BSS.

This gives retailers access to more demand information about consumers than manufacturers. Furthermore, many retailers have begun to share demand information with their upstream manufacturers who provide goods of a certain quality. Because an increasing number of consumers are concerned about product prices and product quality levels and are even willing to pay a higher price for high-quality products, manufacturers consider two production modes to adapt to the market: the Q-before-IS mode or the Q-after-IS mode. To capture substantial consumer markets, retailers have also begun to provide their goods to compete with the manufacturers. Motivated by these practices, this study analyzes the retailer's information-sharing strategy and the manufacturer's production mode selection under price and quality competition. We find that under the Q-before-IS mode, the retailer has no incentive to voluntarily share information with the manufacturer. However, under the Q-after-IS mode, the retailer would share two products' information with the manufacturer when the quality investment cost factor is relatively low. Our findings confirm that the retailer is induced to share information because the retailer and manufacturer participate in the quality and price competition after observing the demand. Moreover, the manufacturer prefers the Q-after-IS (Q-before-IS) mode under the equilibrium information-sharing strategy when the demand fluctuation is large (otherwise). This indicates that the retailer's information-sharing strategy plays a key role in the manufacturer's preferred production mode. © 2023 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.","information sharing; price and quality competition; production mode selection; supply chain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172913826"

Based on an online survey of adult Singaporeans (N = 1002), results from hierarchical OLS regression analyses demonstrated the direct effects of news media attention, trust in AI system, and attitude, alongside several UTAUT2 constructs, on use intention. Results of subsequent mediation analyses using structural equation modelling between trust in AI system, trust in AI engineers and use intention through attitude were consistent with a partial and full mediation effect, respectively. Notably, both trust constructs were influenced by news media attention in comparable magnitudes. In this sense, trust placed in AI system can be seen separately from that placed in engineers responsible for AI development. Furthermore, we found support for including attitude in the UTAUT2 main model for emerging technologies in which information and practice remain largely inaccessible to the public.

This study presents an experiment carefully designed to assess the effectiveness of an innovative project management educational boardgame named PMBoG. Two samples from a class of university students, enrolled in a bachelor's degree management course, participated in the experiment. One sample joined PMBoG sessions playing with and against other colleagues, the other sample did not participate in the sessions. After game sessions, both groups took a project management test to evaluate their capacity to make decisions or countermeasures based on classical project management issues. The test also included a questionnaire about game evaluations and peer feedback. Preliminary analysis using multiple statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, Tuckey and Effect Size) indicates that participants in the experimental group demonstrated statistically significant higher performance compared to those who did not participate in the game sessions. The results suggest that the adoption of PMBoG positively impacts on increase of students' project management competencies.

The study encompasses a comprehensive approach, including an analysis of an innovation entrepreneur database comprising 320 investors and 883 IDEs. Moreover, semi-structure in-depth interviews were conducted with three investors, twenty-two IDEs’ founders, eight executives, and experts from various sectors, including government, university incubators, and the private sector in Thailand. Through this multifaceted investigation, this paper sheds light on the key factors that hinder the success of IDEs in Thailand, which primarily revolve around the quality of entrepreneurs (Team), Product and Market Fit, and Support. These factors collectively impact the depth of knowledge, business incubation, acceleration programs, and the effectiveness of laws, measures, and policies in supporting innovation capability development within IDEs. In addition, this paper presents a framework for Thailand’s IDEs hub, facilitating the connection between the university's innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem with public and private stakeholders. This framework serves as a mechanism to address the identified hindrances and foster a conducive environment for IDEs development. To address the obstacles, this paper proposes three crucial strategies, namely, (1) talent management, (2) ease of doing scaleup, and (3) availability of funding. These strategies are envisioned to counteract the identified challenges and can be effectively implemented through an operating model and practical working procedures tailored to suit the specific context of Thailand. © The Author(s) 2024.","Entrepreneurship; IDEs; Innovation system; Innovation-driven-enterprise; Operating model; Policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186255899"

We conducted an anonymous survey, gathering 313 valid responses, and utilized Structural Equation Modelling to examine the relationships between these factors. Our model incorporates the constructs of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to provide a more comprehensive overview of AI acceptance. Our findings indicate that while literacy fosters a positive attitude towards acceptance, anxiety has a minimal, although significant, direct negative effect, but plays a significant role in mediating the influence of literacy. Specifically, learning and sociotechnical dimensions of AI anxiety serves as a complementary partial mediator between AI literacy and acceptance, meaning that a portion of the effect of literacy on acceptance is mediated through AI anxiety. In contrast, literacy still explains a portion of acceptance independent from anxiety. Our study also confirms that dimensions of technology acceptance, as suggested by TAM, significantly shape individuals' attitudes towards AI as for others digital technology. In this respect, AI literacy positively influences the perception of ease of use and usefulness, thereby contributing to the overall acceptance of AI-based technology.

Despite the effects of operational attributes, including fulfillment cost, speed, time, and convenience, this study further characterizes consumer heterogeneity in fashion shopping with a fashion lifestyle measurement scale, and examines how such heterogeneity differentiates logistics preferences. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire that consists of attitudinal measurements on fashion lifestyles and a stated choice experiment is disseminated to an online panel in Singapore. The collected responses are analyzed using the Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model. Findings: This study concludes the significant effects of fulfillment cost, speed, specificity of home delivery slot, and distance to pickup locations on consumers' logistics choices. Meanwhile, consumers’ fashion lifestyles, including fashion consciousness, brand focus, and enjoyment orientation, are found to have considerable correlations with their heterogeneous logistics preferences. Originality/value: This study fills the knowledge gap regarding online fashion consumers’ logistics preferences. Despite the generic operational attributes, special attention is dedicated to the unique feature of fashion shopping with differentiated shopping motivations. With such treatments, this study advocates the incorporation of segment-specific attributes in future consumer logistics research. Meanwhile, this study pioneers the inspection of the nexus between shopping motivation and logistics preference, which paves a new direction for future exploration. Practical implications: This study allows practitioners to predict channel demand with consumer profiling, and make informed logistics decisions, such as inventory management. This can effectively strengthen practitioners’ economic sustainability to remain competitive in contemporary consumer-centric shopping landscapes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","e-commerce; Fashion shopping; Integrated choice and latent variable model; Last mile delivery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188429939"

A company's data resources can uniquely influence the decisions surrounding products and services within the supply chain. The integrated dual-channel supply chain (DCSC) involves direct online channels utilized by manufacturing service providers alongside offline channels, such as physical retail stores, managed by sales service integrators. The DCSC is capable of performing second-stage data mining services in accordance with the sold products and customer services after the product sales are completed. Subsequently, data resource mining can be achieved through a cross-channel approach. As such, considering the exploration of cross-channel data resources, this study strives to formulate a structure for a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain. Furthermore, utilizing concepts from the Stackelberg and Nash equilibrium game theories, it delves into the analysis of pricing decisions and profit allocation. This examination encompasses distinct closed-loop supply chain configurations, viewed through the lenses of both centralized and decentralized decision-making approaches. In addition, the effects of cross-channel data mining and channel consumption preferences on supply chain decisions are analyzed, and the analysis is conducted in combination with numerical examples. As evidenced by the findings in this investigation, cross-channel data resource mining, consumer channel preference, and the data mining value conversion rate can prominently affect the formulation of pricing strategies and the distribution of profits in closed-loop supply chains. The potential value of data resources can lead to the generation of “external incentives” following the strategy of data resource mining. Furthermore, the data resource mining strategy is promising in stimulating the growth of the product and service markets. Finally, the overall profit of the supply chain is increased with the increase in the efficiency of data resource conversion. Enhancements in the efficacy of data resource conversion correspondingly lead to heightened overall profits within the supply chain. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Centralized and decentralized decision-making; Data resource mining; Dual-channel supply chain; Pricing decisions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185702479"

By examining a dynamic where manufacturers collaborate with social media influencers, the research evaluates the efficacy of bundling products and services versus separate pricing under varying conditions. The study uncovers that the gap between the two service pricing models will increase as the service cost increases. Moreover, the lower the service cost, the more obvious the relative advantage of the bundling model. That is, bundling is most beneficial when service costs are low, whereas separate pricing becomes advantageous as service costs escalate. In addition, the decrease in the rate of product defects can lead to an increase in the relative advantage of the bundling model. Intriguingly, the optimal promotional approach for influencers shifts in response to these pricing strategies, favoring a combined product-service promotion when services are priced separately. The study further reveals a direct correlation between product defect rates and profitability, especially under separate pricing scenarios. These insights offer valuable guidance for manufacturers and influencers in strategizing their offerings and promotions in the digital marketplace. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Channel strategies; Influencer marketing channel; Pricing; Products and service bundle","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189005348"

Our results indicate firms with blockchain capabilities have less mean negative stock price reaction—on average, a reduced 8.24 % shareholder value loss across crisis stages. Different blockchain application fields exhibit varied shareholder value effects—in general, production blockchain applications can help firms reduce more negative impact while financial blockchain applications show no significant mitigation effects.

Traceability is a powerful tool to ensure them, but implementing a transparent and effective system is a complex operation. As a result, innovative systems, like blockchain, could be introduced. Although research on its impacts in the agri-food is recent, the literature appears fragmented. The objective is to investigate the studied aspects of the blockchain adoption in agri-food, with the purpose of retrieving meaningful considerations about the current state of the art about strategic high-value supply chains, such as wine and olive oil, particularly subjected to fraudulent behaviors. A productivity measurement was applied to retrieve the evolution of the number of documents through the years, the most productive countries, the sources, the research areas, and the most significant papers in terms of number of citations received. To understand the research trends, a co-occurrence analysis was employed. Results show that most of the existing studies focus on the role of blockchain in the resolution of some critical issues as food safety and frauds. While wine is currently an emerging sector in which this approach can be implemented, olive oil still needs more attention. In both cases, blockchain could potentially help to support the profitability and sustainability of the production. The research underlines the importance of focusing on the environmental and social dimension of the blockchain phenomenon and the use of technology to improve the efficiency of agri-food chains and reduce waste and resource use. © The Author(s) 2024.","Agri-food; Bibliometric review; Digitalization; Traceability; Transparency; Wine and olive oil","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187886777"

Customer experience may be enhanced through the use of derivative works, a powerful marketing strategy, and experience intensification. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of customer experience on the intention to purchase derivative works and the mediating effect of experience intensification. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data, with 326 valid questionnaires returned. Structural equation modelling was used to test the conceptual model. The results suggest that Schmitt's five strategic experiential modules influence experience intensification and customers' intention to purchase derivative works to different degrees. Additionally, customers with a higher level of experience intensification are more likely to purchase derivative works, and, importantly, intensification strengthens the influence of customer experience on the intention to purchase derivative works. By combining tangible (derivative works) and intangible (customer experience) products and viewing the outcomes of customer experience as a series of responses, ranging from experience intensification to the intention to purchase derivative works, this paper contributes to the consumer experience literature. This study offers insights for managers to enhance the various dimensions of customer experience and optimise derivative work marketing strategies through experience intensification.

As bank clients become more likely to use online services and contactless payment, the amount of consumer data available for banks’ digitalization strategies has increased. This acceleration in digital banking has placed a spotlight on retail banks’ efforts to protect personal data. Bank staff are on the frontlines of both protecting personal data and communicating their banks’ efforts in this respect to maintain consumer trust. Our study aimed to answer the following question: How did the sudden increase in digitalization during the pandemic affect bank staff’s capabilities in protecting personal data? In a two-stage qualitative study, we collected empirical data on bank staff’s data protection efforts during accelerated digitalization. Analyzing our findings from the perspective of technological mediation theory, which focuses on the relationships between technologies, practices, and social arrangements, we found that in banking platformization, bank staff are disempowered in supporting clients, who are responsibilized for protecting themselves from fraud. Competitive pressures push retail banks into using client data in ways beyond sector norms, endangering the contextual integrity of data flows. Further, our findings show that digitalization presents bank clients with new risks, of which they are informed only after changing their banking practices, and it may be difficult to return to former arrangements. The application of mediation theory, combined with contextual integrity theory, clarified the shifting positions of different digital technology users in the infrastructural network of platformized banking and allowed for an in-depth analysis of conflicting interests. By clarifying these interests, difficulties were identified that need to be addressed in public policy and digital innovation projects to prevent loss of trust among bank clients. © 2024, The Author(s).","Bank staff; Banks; Digitalization; Pandemic; Privacy and data protection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182693972"

Prefabricated housebuilding companies, as supply entities, play a vital role toward successful projects using prefabricated products. Many companies go into liquidation due to poor performance. Supply chain management performance is linked with organizational performance in the manufacturing domain. However, there is no performance framework to date for prefabricated housebuilding companies using supply chain management theory. The purpose of this study is to identify the supply chain management interventions in prefabricated housebuilding research and report relevant key performance indicators based on empirical evidence. These indicators were classified under performance dimensions and supply chain processes. These indicators were then checked for relevancy with subject matter by academic and industry experts engaged in prefabricated construction research and practice, respectively. Later an industry-wide Likert scale-based survey was conducted with experienced experts in practice, involved in the prefabricated construction business, for validation of the proposed framework. This study reports 40 key performance indicators, ranked under six principal component bodies of supply chain management, with low to high ranges from marketing to strategic management. The purposive selection is used for industry consultation with experts having practical experience. Survey results show all the indicators are highly significant except ""Supplier driven strategy""which is still under a medium range of relative importance index.

The data was collected through an online survey conducted among Klang Valley residents. Stratified random sampling was used to gather the data and structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied for the data analysis. The findings revealed that perceived value is a significant predictor of the intention to adopt digital-only banks. Furthermore, perceived convenience, economic efficiency, functional risk, trust, and environmental concern determined the perceived value of digital-only banks. However, security risk, critical mass, and number of services were non-significant predictors of perceived value. Notably, perceived value plays a significant mediating role between certain determinants and adoption intention. This research adds value by revealing multifaceted determinants of perceived value and incorporating environmental concern that highlights the significance of green perceived value in shaping adoption intention. Furthermore, it provides empirical results on a research gap related to digital-only banks' perceived value mediating effect on the intention to adopt these banks.

Exploratory factor analysis was utilized to derive the fintech variables, while the bank stock return variable was calculated using a basket of eight listed banks from 2017w46 to 2021w46. The results were estimated using the vector autoregression and Granger causality method and validated with the copula method. A key finding of this study is the presence of a simultaneous negative change and bidirectional causality between bank stock returns and fintech lending. Furthermore, several other interesting findings were discovered: (1) the causal relationship from fintech to bank stock returns is weaker compared with the opposite direction; (2) unidirectional causality exists between different types of fintech, such as influence from FinFintech to FinLending, from FinPayment to FinLending and FinWallet, from FinMoney to FinFintech, from FinWallet to FinLending, and from FinProduct to FinFintech; and (3) there is an equal occurrence of simultaneous increase or decrease between bank stock returns and certain types of fintech, specifically between BankReturn and FinPayment, BankReturn and FinLending, as well as BankReturn and FinWallet.

This study considers the competition among different manufacturers and multiple demand markets in the supply chain network. We examine and compare their equilibrium decision conditions under three common carbon policies: carbon cap, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon tax. Results suggest that under lower carbon caps, manufacturers greatly reduce their carbon emissions by reducing production quantities, which causes a decrease in profits. However, an appropriate carbon cap size can not only motivate manufacturers to reduce carbon emissions but also improve their profits. Under a certain price for carbon credit, the effectiveness of a carbon cap-and-trade policy is similar to that of a carbon cap policy, but it has more flexibility. Carbon tax is effective, but it brings more tax burden to manufacturers. We provide implications for companies to optimize their production methods to achieve sustainability. © 2023 The Authors.

We calculated their coordinated development levels using kernel density estimation, spatial autocorrelation, and Markov chain analysis to explore the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of their coordinated development. The results indicate that (1) the resilience level of the digital economy is on the rise, while efficiency fluctuations are decreasing. Resilience exhibits an “east high–west low” spatial pattern with the “Hu Huanyong Line” as a boundary, while efficiency shows a “collapse in the central and northern regions” trend. (2) The overall level of coordinated development between resilience and efficiency has decreased; however, the differences in coordination between different regions have reduced, gradually forming a spatial pattern of “high in the east, low in the west, low in the south, and high in the north.” (3) A significant positive spatial correlation exists between the development levels of digital economic resilience and efficiency, which continues to strengthen over time.

The proposed methodology for vulnerability heatmapping consists of three dimensions: (1) physical, (2) infrastructure, and (3) environmental. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used to quantify the debris three-dimensional (3D) volumetric information as part of the 11 metrics selected and evaluated to establish the vulnerability of a location. The proposed process incorporates all systems into a process to allow decision makers to quickly determine scope, complexity, potential impact, and recovery needs.

The evolution of these elements influences and guides the strategic choices of policymakers to develop potential improvements. Measures of economic and social well-being are widely studied in the literature as essential tools for understanding and promoting more equitable, sustainable and inclusive social and economic progress; they provide a more complete and holistic view of people's well-being, enabling more informed policies and decisions that meet a country's needs. Investments in scientific research and innovation, the human capital available for knowledge economy processes and the diffusion of Information and Communication Technologies are fundamental elements of social well-being and economic development. The literature highlights the need for indicators that analyze the efficiency levels of innovation, research and creativity activities to guide policies that promote better resource use. In light of this, the study aims to formulate a composite index that summarizes the “Innovation, research and creativity” dimension of the Equitable and Sustainable Wellbeing (BES) Report. The analysis focuses on Italy and provides a detailed measure of the situation in research, creativity, and innovation, which are indirect determinants of well-being but fundamental to social and economic progress. The authors propose an index for classifying Italian Regions by utilizing indicators from the BES and the Agenda 2030 and employing hierarchical clustering analysis associated with an algorithm based on the P2 distance method. From a broader perspective, the work provides a robust tool that combines various measures into a single value. This offers a more comprehensive view of a complex situation and allows for the identification of general trends or changes over time. Furthermore, this enables a more targeted assessment of goal achievement than analysing isolated individual variables. The results show the goodness and robustness of the proposed index. Therefore, the proposed index is a valuable tool capable of providing a comprehensive view of the situation, identifying trends, regional or national patterns, and information essential for governments to formulate strategies. © 2024 The Authors","Agenda 2030; BES; Creativity; Indicators; Innovation; Research","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189861887"

While these transformations are welcomed and while societies are generally moving towards modernization and digitalization, farmers in the Global South have not been transitioning into the age of digitalization, and so are unable to take full advantage in ways that can enhance the agro value chain. Considering this, what may account for the sub-optimal take up from digital transformation deployment in agriculture sector in a small island developing state? Has there been any successes to the agriculture value-chain? What are the lessons to be learned? While the systems are available and farmers may have an interest in using them, their lack of ability to maneuver these new technologies leads to non-take up/use of the new beneficial technologies. A general distrust in government further compounded by a general distrust in the use of the internet has polarized farmers from digital technologies. The sluggish operations of governments of the South have inhibited the innovation that is required to enhance take up of digital technologies in agriculture. Privatization of digitalization in agriculture is therefore proffered as an alternative to a state-owned and state-operated digital transformation of agriculture.

It is also necessary to determine the appropriate investor profile according to the conditions of a country. This protects investors from major losses. Therefore, there is a strong need for a new study that analyzes the risk profiles of derivative products in emerging economies. This study aims to identify the most appropriate investor risk profile for derivative instruments in emerging economies. It constructs a novel decision-making model. In this model, the facial action coding system, quantum theory, spherical fuzzy sets, and multi-stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (M-SWARA) methodology are integrated to minimize uncertainty in this process. First, three main participants of derivatives for financial technology investors are evaluated using the quantum spherical fuzzy M-SWARA technique. After that, seven emerging economies are ranked based on this performance using quantum spherical fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. The main contribution is that an appropriate investor profile is identified for financial derivative investments in emerging economies. One of the important originalities of this study is the development of a new technique called M-SWARA by making some improvements to the classical stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis method. It is concluded that hedging is the most appropriate purpose for making investments in derivative products in emerging economies. It is also identified that China has the greatest performance among the seven emerging economies regarding the appropriate purpose for making derivative investments. For the effective management of this problem in these countries, it is recommended to prevent the speculative use of derivative products with legal regulations. © 2024, The Author(s).","Decision making; Derivative investments; Efficiency; Financial innovation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181904938"

This study examines the impact of SMI over-endorsement on consumer purchase intentions, mediating this relationship through influencer authenticity and credibility, and moderating it with product interest. Employing a moderated-mediation model using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), this study analyzes survey data collected from 303 social media users. Contrary to intuitive expectations, SMI over-endorsement does not directly affect consumer purchase intentions; instead, its negative influence is significantly mediated by reduced perceptions of credibility among SMIs, with product interest serving as a mitigating mechanism. This revelation challenges conventional beliefs by revealing that the negative repercussions of excessive endorsements are mediated by credibility erosion, overshadowing any concerns regarding authenticity. Importantly, this adverse effect can be mitigated by fostering product interest as a strategic buffer. This suggests that rather than curtailing endorsement frequencies, brands and SMIs should focus on amplifying product interest (e.g., by enhancing product engagement and relevance) and thus sustain or even increase endorsement activities without compromising the perceived credibility of influencers, thereby maintaining the effectiveness of influencer marketing campaigns. This study therefore contributes novel insights into the dynamics of influencer marketing, particularly the adverse effects of over-endorsement on consumer behavior and the conditions under which these effects may be neutralized. © 2024 The Authors","Influencer authenticity; Influencer credibility; Influencer marketing; Over-endorsement; Product interest; Purchase intention; Social media influencer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188716979"

A survey questionnaire is designed for data collection (n = 387) and structural equation modelling is applied for data analysis. Our findings suggest gamification affordances of competition, achievement, self-expression, and interactivity as the factors that directly or indirectly influence consumers' intention to engage in green logistics behaviour. This influence is mediated through perceived enjoyment, ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, we find that consumers may prioritise social factors such as interactivity affordance over competition and achievement affordances in the gamified green logistics behaviour.

From a methodological statistical perspective, the performance of Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest are compared in a blockchain data analysis. The effective machine-learning-based analysis reveals that the Regusto platform gives people greater access to the surplus food redistributed by non-profit organizations and suppliers through both donations and sales.

By integrating DIGE, RIS, and innovation output into a unified analytical framework, this study examined the impact and mechanisms of DIGE on innovation output across 330 Chinese cities from 2011 to 2020. Results show that DIGE development significantly contributes to innovation output. This contribution is mediated by DIGE's strengthening of the RIS, primarily through its facilitation of integration into innovation networks and enhancement of the innovation environment. Regional heterogeneities are evident in the innovation-promoting influence of DIGE, with less developed cities, cities with underdeveloped infrastructure, and smaller cities benefiting more significantly. While the direct impact of DIGE on large central cities is subtle, their pivotal positions enable them to radiate and disseminate innovation spillovers to connected cities through extensive cooperative networks. This study underscored the potential of leveraging DIGE, especially in disadvantaged regions, to cultivate robust and synergistic RIS and act as catalysts for augmented innovation output. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Digital economy; Innovation cooperation; Innovation output; R&D element flow; Regional innovation system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183543286"

In subsequent phases of the ECT, the significance of expectations in influencing customers’ attitudes towards confirmed trust and satisfaction was emphasised. The Trust-based Expectation-Confirmation model was therefore proposed to study trust at the appropriate level of abstraction to capture and analyse the relationships between Expected Trust, Perceived Trust, and the Confirmation of Expected Trust. The evaluation of the proposed ECT Trust-based model was conducted through a web-based survey with 559 participants, aiming to examine the direct and indirect approaches of measuring the Confirmation phase. Both approaches were found to be problematic in terms of the gap between the Perceived and Expected construct measured, which cannot be adjusted by the middle point on the Likert scale when using the direct approach either.

Subsequent debates on the topic have captured the interest of many simulation professionals and researchers. This study lends credence to the discourse with evidence. In January 2020, a global health crisis named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred, infecting and killing millions of people globally, leading to community lockdowns and travel restrictions, and bringing the world to a standstill. Scientists scrambled for quick, practical solutions to stem the tide. Operational research (OR) and management science (MS) techniques, including modeling and simulation, provide effective methods to make COVID-19 infection forecasts, assign/optimize intensive care unit beds, initiate healthcare management/control strategies, and decision-making. The global pandemic problems offer an opportunity to evaluate the discourse on DES's continuous relevance and potency as an OR/MS technique. Utilizing bibliometric performance evaluation and text analytics of publications addressing various COVID-19 pandemic problems, the results show an extensive use, relevance, and impact of the DES technique across multidisciplinary domains, including medical/healthcare, social and behavioral sciences, business, molecular biosciences, and more. The intellectual structure highlights strong multidisciplinary collaboration among sources in decision sciences, healthcare, natural, behavioral, and social sciences.

The internal dimension involves crucial aspects, such as research activities, while the external dimension concerns the university's environment. The adoption and implementation of smart technologies have significantly improved the performance of various institutions, particularly universities. Consequently, the two dimensions intersect, allowing technological advancements from the outside to increase efficiency within universities. In this context, it is relevant to evaluate how the level of digitalization in the external environment can affect the efficiency of universities. This study aims to investigate the efficiency levels of Italian universities using three methodological techniques. First, the efficiency level of Italian universities was assessed using Data Envelopment Analysis. Second, Conditional Data Envelopment Analysis was used to estimate the conditioning role of the digitalization level of municipalities where Italian universities are located.

Using the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework, we analyse interview data collected from blockchain experts and accountants (N = 19). The findings confirm the influence of nine context-specific factors, highlighting the challenges and lack of knowledge in understanding the usage and benefits of blockchain in accounting, its complex integration with existing accounting systems, and the increased costs associated with the adoption intention. This study provides novel empirical evidence of the factors by adequately contextualising an established theoretical framework in the context of accounting.

This study delves into the empirical analysis of how the digital economy influences entrepreneurial activities and the resulting gaps across cities. To achieve this, panel data from Chinese cities between 2011 and 2020, coupled with statistical information about registered enterprises in China's industrial and commercial sectors, are employed. Additionally, the study examines emerging digital risks and suggests corrective measures stemming from the rapid digital economic expansion. The findings of this research reveal that the digital economy fosters increased entrepreneurial activity within cities while simultaneously widening the gap in such activity across different urban areas—a phenomenon akin to the “Matthew effect.” Importantly, these conclusions withstand rigorous testing for endogeneity and robustness. In response to digitalization risks, establishing a robust intellectual property protection system emerges as an effective countermeasure. The government's role is pivotal: it should expedite urban digitization by prioritizing new infrastructure development and fostering a conducive business environment. Furthermore, it must remain vigilant to the potential exacerbation of the “Matthew effect” and regional developmental imbalances prompted by the digital economy. © 2024","Digital economy; Digitalization risk; Entrepreneurial activity; Intellectual property protection; Regional disparity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187695170"

Four studies using a mixed-method approach reveal that the use of AI recommendations in streaming platforms creates an autonomy-technology tension that reduces consumers' performance expectancy, thus lowering their satisfaction. However, such effects are contingent on the nature of the AI recommendations.

Clarifying the impact and mechanism of digital transformation on enterprise pollution reduction has important policy implications for the synergistic development of digitalization and greenization. This paper explores the impact of digital transformation on enterprise pollution abatement using data from Chinese manufacturing enterprises and fixed effects models. The empirical results show that digital transformation contributes to enterprise pollution reduction. Furthermore, the pollution reduction role of digital transformation is more pronounced in enterprises with high degrees of pollution intensity. Digital transformation acts on pollution reduction through productivity improvement and scale expansion, while a mechanism for green technology innovation does not exist. Additionally, industry attributes and external environment heterogeneity affect the pollution abatement role of digital transformation. Enterprises can achieve stronger pollution abatement from digital transformation when they belong to high-polluting industries, high-tech industries, areas with high environmental regulation (HER), and cohorts. The paper provides new micro evidence that digital transformation promotes pollution reduction, enriches the literature on the environmental impact of digital transformation, and provides beneficial insights for enterprises to drive pollution reduction in the era of the digital economy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","China; Cohort effects; Digital transformation; Manufacturing enterprises; Pollution reduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188905049"

Drawing from the intersection of open strategy (OS) and SE, we seek to enhance understanding of the open strategizing process by elucidating stakeholder inclusion practices in a smart city initiative, focusing on food systems in Da Nang, Vietnam. Our participatory action research draws on 114 semi-structured interviews and four stakeholder workshops to analyze the way stakeholder inclusion practices unfold in the strategic decision-making process of a smart city initiative. Our analysis reveals that stakeholder inclusion is complex and involves four interdependent practices at different stages of the strategizing process. These practices are trust formation, common language creation, role transformation, and expectation alignment. Together, they culminate in the creation of an interactive social space for the strategy-making process. The proposed analytical framework highlights the interdependencies among practices and their outcomes at different stages of the open strategizing process and could serve as a guideline in a context in which stakeholder inclusion at the planning phase is necessary to achieve systemic change. © 2024 The Authors","Action Research; Food system; Inclusion; Open Strategy; Smart City; Stakeholder Engagement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188878428"

Emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, Virtual and Augmented Reality, and Blockchain are reshaping the animation industry's value chain. This paper explores the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on various stages of the animation industry's value chain, including conceptualization, pre-production, production, post-production, distribution, and consumption. Through a combination of literature review and semi-structured interviews, the paper identifies key capabilities of Industry 4.0 technologies in the animation industry. Subsequently, experts from different countries were engaged to validate and evaluate these capabilities, scoring them based on their importance and effectiveness in production and marketing activities. Analysis of data from 60 experts resulted in the identification of the most critical capabilities, which were categorized into four groups based on their relation to either the production or marketing of animation products. Furthermore, the analysis of questionnaires enabled the development of four scenarios depicting the potential future trajectories of animation companies based on their adoption of Industry 4.0 capabilities. The paper delves deeper into each scenario, elucidating their underlying factors and characteristics. Ultimately, it is predicted that companies leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies for both production and marketing activities will emerge as the leaders of the animation industry.

Existing travel recommendation systems were not designed for such applications, nor do they have the relevant ability to recommend domestic overseas-like travel experiences to support travel decision making. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the development of a recommendation model based on the visual content of photos for domestic overseas-like travel experiences and a prototype application. The application uses the latest advancement in computer vision — the concept model — to learn high-level concepts in an overseas travel destination photo collection to identify similar domestic travel experiences. We demonstrate the usability of the prototype application with a large-scale data set of approximately 479,000 travel photos taken in several countries and evaluate its utility and efficacy through four focus groups with target users. © 2023 The Authors","Concept modelling; Decision support systems; Flickr; Recommender systems; Travel decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180608494"

In varying degrees, some of these measures cause disruptions in their way of offering educational services, whereas others enable them to continue offering their services to students. By surveying the relevant literature based on the Scopus database between 2020 and 2022 (inclusive), this study provides insight into governments’ educational policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and their implications. For data analysis, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) is utilized to explore government contingent policies related to higher education. R-studio is employed for thematic mapping based on keywords and abstracts from selected papers to integrate and present themes and current trends. Based on the analyzed results of 43 papers, it is concluded that during the COVID-19 pandemic, government policies were strongly associated with higher education digital transformation. Moreover, the government mainly plays a critical role in restructuring budgets, building infrastructures, and establishing social initiatives to support HEIs and students during the crisis. For the mentioned reasons, this study indicates the importance of governments’ role and their policymaking strategies in terms of faculty development program initiations, funding and budget structure, administration, support for upgrading the existing information technology infrastructure, and establishment of new digital platforms to mitigate health risks while ensuring desirable learning outcomes through digital means during health crisis. © 2024 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Digital transformation; Educational innovation; Government policies; Higher education; PRISMA","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185483037"

Using data from A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2020, we test our hypothesis and find that CSR facilitates digital transformation of firms and that the effect is persistent. Mechanism tests show that CSR promotes digital transformation only by improving firms' human and technological resources. In addition, the facilitating role of CSR is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises.

However, a significant number of people across the globe still lack access to safe drinking water and practice open defecation. Therefore, evidence-based research is needed to guide policymakers in improving WASH adoption and practice across the globe. In this study, we add to knowledge and policy by probing the role of income inequality and financial inclusion on access to improved WASH facilities using a comprehensive panel dataset from 119 countries between 2004 and 2020. We used the heteroskedasticity-based instrumental variable regression and the Driscoll-Kraay estimator to account for endogeneity and cross-sectional dependency inherent in panel data, respectively. Our preferred endogeneity and cross-sectional dependency-corrected results show that income inequality reduces access to safe WASH facilities. Our study demonstrates that financial inclusion significantly increases access to safe WASH facilities. Income inequality and financial inclusion have heterogeneous effects on access to safe WASH facilities across rural and urban settings, income groups, and geographical regions. Through our interaction and marginal effect analysis, we document that improvement in financial inclusion reduces the adverse effect of income inequality on safe WASH adoption and practices. These findings highlight that policies that strengthen financial inclusion services and further address income inequality would improve WASH adoption and practices. Considering the inhibiting and enhancing effects of income inequality and financial inclusion, respectively, governments could adopt social welfare policies to tackle the former and also put in measures to enhance financial development and inclusion to enhance the latter. © 2024 The Author(s)","Financial inclusion; Hygiene; Income inequality; Sanitation; WASH; Water","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185759072"

The enforcement of privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies these challenges, as certain stringent privacy requirements within GDPR may conflict with BCT's features. However, little attention is given to such critical issues. This study draws on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theoretical lens as a mechanism to unfold the issue. The current research focuses on exploring the tensions and the opportunities for synergy through the lens of TOE to prevent privacy regulatory compliance failure. We analyzed 71 multidisciplinary research studies that highlight the areas of friction and present a unifying structure for research synthesis. In response to the identified areas of friction and potential opportunities for coexistence, we formulate nine research propositions centered around six prominent and contentious data privacy and protection requirements within the GDPR. This research contributes to the broader discourse on privacy regulatory-compliant blockchain-based solutions by providing a theoretical foundation for future investigation into this critical area. The study suggests that reconciling BCT and privacy regulation requirements will unlock BCT's full potential, creating a secure, privacy-conscious technology infrastructure and offering practical implications and insights for policymakers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain technology; Friction; GDPR; Opportunities; Privacy regulation","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182671047"

We make a novel contribution to the literature by uncovering an asymmetry in adopting Industry 4.0 technologies among Russian industrial firms in domestic value chains (DVCs) and global value chains (GVCs). This asymmetry has the potential to impede GVC localization and DVC internationalization. Based on our results, software automation solutions are the only ones demonstrating statistical significance for firms participating simultaneously in GVCs, DVCs, and both GVCs and DVCs. Companies in DVCs demonstrate a broader utilization of Industry 4.0 technologies across various application areas. We also identify evidence of reshoring in DVCs, indicating that Industry 4.0 adoption encourages firms to establish enduring relationships with domestic suppliers. Highlighting that differences in technology adoption are influenced by external factors, including adherence to international standards and regulatory principles, we propose policy implications for developing countries. Recommendations encompass reducing entry barriers to DVCs, improving procurement transparency, and promoting competition in the digital solutions market to empower firms for seamless GVC integration. © 2024 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd","Backward linkages; Domestic value chains; Forward linkages; Global value chains; Industry 4.0","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188582563"

Drawing on Stiegler's theory of transindividuation, understood as the trans-formation of individuals, groups and technologies, and his emphasis on technology-mediated memory, we propose that varying types of accounting records cultivate different memory forms by fostering spatiotemporal projections which reshape the societal perception and comprehension of accounting. Our analysis relies on a comparison between two decentralized transaction recording systems similar in their operations, but which emerged in two different eras: blockchain and early double-entry bookkeeping. Our approach draws from Haydu (1998) to identify similarities and contrasts between different periods which can emphasize the uniqueness of each, while conceptualizing long-term trends. By juxtaposing DEB and BC as instances of decentralized records, the study postulates a critical shift in accounting's transindividuation over time. We argue that while DEB's norms of recording aided in the formation of collective memory and long-term projections, turning records into objects of social investment, BC's recording, propelled by automation and an economic emphasis, manifests as an isolated numerical sequence hindering the scope of human projections. We posit that compared to early DEB, BC recording, although it holds the potential for democratization, may lead to divisions between users, among themselves, and with their records. We discuss the potential implications of this trans-dividuation process for notions of accountability, transparency, regulation, and the broader political role of accounting in society. © 2023 The Author(s)","Automation; Blockchain; Double-entry bookkeeping; Memory forms; Projections; Recording; Stiegler; Theoretical history; Transindividuation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173735488"

This study discusses six strategic factors, including business environment, digital infrastructure, financial capability, innovation capability, information security, and public demand, and identifies the configurations that lead to a significant increase in digital government performance. Based on the theory of strategic action fields, we developed a theoretical framework to understand the DGT process and changes in configurations. Based on a novel Multiple Time Differencing Qualitative Comparative Analysis (MTD/QCA) method, the analysis of 31 provincial regions in Chinese mainland over four years derived 13 distinct solutions in the three basic stages of DGT: exploration, concentration, and complementation. These findings reveal the complexity of DGT from an evolutionary perspective and indicate that these factors do not work in isolation, but in combination with others to promote DGT. Understanding the configurational relationships of these factors can help governments adjust their strategies across the three stages of DGT. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Digital government; Digital transformation; Qualitative comparative analysis; Strategic action fields","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185250384"

We consider the problem of determining the features of a new product that a monopolist will introduce into a market that contains an existing product as well as setting the prices of the existing and the new products. The firm also decides on offering only the new product or both the existing and the new products. We explicitly capture the effects of unique features, which are specific to one of the two products, and common features which are shared between the new and the existing product on these decisions. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear-mixed-integer program with general cost, demand, and price functions. For the case of linear cost, demand, and price, the nonlinear-mixed-integer program is converted to a nonlinear program and solved analytically. Based on this solution, the optimal prices for both products and the optimal unique features for the new product are derived in closed form, a linear-time algorithm is presented to determine the optimal common features, and the optimality conditions of keeping the existing product in the market are characterized. We show that the selection of the unique features, but not the common ones, is based on the difference between a feature's contribution to the product's demand and its cost adjusted by the price sensitivity in the linear case. Moreover, we find that the firm, if it wants to avoid demand cannibalization, should remove the existing product from the market rather than offer two products with mainly unique features. Capturing the effects of unique and common features directly allows firms to decide on the best rollover strategy and determine the right features and prices. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Feature-based product design; New product introduction; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Product rollover","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181885414"

As natural gas in Europe is highly dependent on imports, import prices are inevitably affected by monetary policy uncertainties. Additionally, monetary policy uncertainty has a significant impact on financial markets. As a unique financial market, the carbon market is affected by monetary policy uncertainties, but the mechanism of the impact is not yet clear. Therefore, we conduct a systematic study of the relationships between monetary policy uncertainty, European imported natural gas prices, and carbon prices in the last three phases of European Union emission trading scheme. This study uses the dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (DCC-GARCH) model and nonlinear auto-regressive distributed lag (NARDL) model to comprehensively analyse the correlation between these three variables, including volatility correlations and trend correlations. The results show that the dynamic conditional correlations between carbon and gas prices are mostly positive, as is the dynamic conditional correlations between natural gas prices and monetary policy uncertainty. However, the dynamic conditional correlations between carbon prices and monetary policy uncertainty gradually decreases and changes from positive to negative in 2015. In addition, the findings indicate the asymmetry of the short-term impact and long-term impact of monetary policy uncertainties and imported natural gas prices on the carbon prices trends. Monetary policy uncertainty has asymmetric effects on carbon prices in each phase of the research. However, the natural gas prices have asymmetric effects only in Phases 2 and 4. Based on the findings, some policy proposals are provided for the development of the carbon markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Asymmetric effects; Carbon prices; European imported natural gas prices; Monetary policy uncertainty","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189551539"

However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era.

However, the determinants driving robot adoption for educational purposes, particularly in developing countries, are not yet well understood. Additionally, the existing literature does not examine the fitness between robot capabilities and education-related tasks. Therefore, this research integrates the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and task-technology fit (TTF) to examine robot adoption in higher education. Based on 177 responses collected from university students, the proposed model is verified using a hybrid structural equation modeling and artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach. The findings indicated that effort expectancy is positively affected by individual technology fit and task technology fit. Further, performance expectancy is significantly driven by task technology fit, but not individual technology fit. The results also supported the role of performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation in affecting behavioral intention, with a variance of 65% in the latter. With a normalized value of 94.5%, the ANN results revealed that social influence is the most important factor affecting robot adoption.

These systems aim to recognize and locate weed species within a crop field, using precision equipment to apply required herbicides timely and only where needed, with the objective of reducing the sprayable surface required to eliminate the given weed and protect the crop, with both economic and environmental benefits. Yet, with climate change on the rise, common weeds are expected to undergo some changes to adapt to their environment, possibly with new or invasive weeds spreading to areas where they did not exist before. These changes (often morphological) as well as new invasions need to be taken into account by future classifiers and detection algorithms to ensure system robustness and adaptation to new habitats/climate dynamics. This paper proposes a set of experiments evaluating the use of transfer learning and zero-shot learning for weed classification using our novel TomatoWeeds dataset. Residual networks of variable depth, pretrained on the Imagenet and/or DeepWeeds datasets were evaluated. A ResNet50 pretrained on both datasets and fine-tuned on the TomatoWeeds dataset performed best, returning a holdout set accuracy of 77.8%, showing the advantageous use of transfer learning in this domain. Zero-shot learning, using both embeddings of images and morphological and habitat text-based descriptions, is implemented to test the ability of machine learning pipelines of recognizing unseen classes at test time (which may arise e.g. due to changing climate dynamics), a learning task in which the field (and our experiments) are still far from satisfactory results. Further research could benefit from larger weed-specific datasets for transfer learning as well as deeper network architectures to improve model performance. The projection-based ZSL could also benefit from larger datasets and new zero-shot learning architectures in hope that unseen classes are accurately projected. © 2024 The Author(s)","Computer vision; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Residual networks; Site-specific weed management; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187962380"

The main purpose of this study is to explore whether the development of Fintech impacts the financial inclusion of village and township banks (VTBs). Using the micro survey data of 900 VTBs, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of financial technology on the financial inclusion of VTBs and explores the mediating role of mobile banking adoption. The results demonstrate that the development of Fintech can improve the financial inclusion of VTBs through the application of mobile banking. Notably, VTBs can significantly contribute to financial inclusion by adopting an online and offline service model, though mobile banking is substituting physical branches with the rapid development of financial technology. Further analysis finds that the development of Fintech has prompted VTBs to increase the inclusiveness of loans to rural households, loans to poor households, and loans to small and micro enterprises. Furthermore, rural credit institutions and city commercial banks as the main shareholders are conducive to strengthening the role of Fintech in promoting the financial inclusion of VTBs. Finally, the development of Fintech has a stronger competitive incentive for VTBs located in the eastern regions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Financial inclusion; Fintech; Mobile banking; Village and township banks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187561749"

Through the analysis of 307 paired data collected from multi-wave and multi-source questionnaires using Smart-PLS software, the results show that both work-related and social-related ESM use can promote employees' psychological meaningfulness, availability, and safety, thus further stimulating employees' improvisation ability. ESM policies only significantly moderated the effects of work-related ESM use on the three psychological conditions of employees. Moreover, there are significant differences in the intensity of the influence of the two types of ESM uses on the psychological conditions of employees.

This study employed a mixed methods approach to investigate technology adoption rates and assess the perceived impacts on performance, injuries, operations, and fan experience in 21 sports organizations. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 industry experts, providing information on decision drivers, implementation challenges, emerging innovations, and ethical considerations associated with responsible technology integration. The survey findings revealed extensive usage of analytics, wearables, management information systems, and fan engagement platforms among the sports organizations under investigation. Notably, analytics and statistics tools, along with management information systems, were identified as having the most significant influence on enhancing organizational performance and efficiency. Wearable technologies emerged as crucial tools for injury prevention through the monitoring of athlete health metrics. Insights gleaned from the expert interviews underscored the potential of emerging technologies, such as augmented reality, athlete tracking, predictive analytics, exoskeletons, and AI coaching, in the sports industry. However, experts also highlighted implementation challenges, including financial considerations, skills gaps, resistance to change, uncertainties surrounding return on investment demonstration, and ethical risks that necessitate mitigation measures. The study results indicated that data-driven systems have the capacity to improve operations and athlete outcomes; however, an over-reliance on such systems may diminish the significance of human expertise. It is imperative that responsible integration of these technologies aligns with organizational goals and values. By investigating current trends in technology adoption, assessing perceived impacts, and considering stakeholder viewpoints through an integrated methodology, this study aimed to provide evidence-based guidance for maximizing the benefits of digital transformation in a responsible manner. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Athlete wellbeing; Digital technology; Information management; Sports industry; Sports training","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187201015"

To this end, the article is based on a field study involving 14 auditing companies, both Big4 and non-Big4, from the list provided by Consob. The results reveal auditors’ differing perceptions and opinions regarding the future of auditing firms. According to the first viewpoint, new technologies will have a positive impact on auditors as they will be allowed to focus on value-added activities. Second, some respondents do not expect changes to the traditional structure of the companies due to the application of digital tools, while other auditors hypothesised two different scenarios regarding structural changes. Third, the interviewees contend that auditors of the future should gain IT and data analytics skills, which could affect the hiring practices of these companies. Fourth, regarding the current differences between large and smaller firms, some participants stated that emerging technologies could widen that gap, while some auditors of non-Big4 firms claimed that modern tools offer an opportunity for the smaller companies to slightly reduce the gap.

Guided by an intrapreneurial ecosystem framework, our analysis is based on a combination of administrative and survey panel data for 141 UK higher education institutions. We arrive at several contributing findings. These suggest that the intrapreneurial ecosystem within academia is increasingly predisposed towards enhancing the quality of graduate outcomes rather than simply promoting raw measures such as graduate jobs or the number of graduate start-ups. Furthermore, we reveal the critical role of University national stakeholder networks for graduate career satisfaction, start-up generation, and undergraduate employment. Finally, our empirical exercise and its results demonstrate the practical value of the proposed concept of the intrapreneurial ecosystem for University management and practitioners, not least because it systematically identifies areas for an immediate, medium- and long-term action. © 2024 The Author(s)","Academic intrapreneurship; Graduate employability; Graduate entrepreneurship; Graduate wellbeing; Intrapreneurial ecosystem","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189747648"

To gain valuable insights into this evolving ecosystem, analyzing transaction data using network analysis methodology proves to be highly effective. Network analysis allows us to uncover intricate relationships, patterns, and communities within the DeFi market by examining participant transactions. We model nodes group representing actors or wallet addresses, and edges represent transactions between wallet addresses. This study focuses on three prominent DeFi token-based Ethereum protocols: DAI, UNI, and WBTC. We analyzed 5,802,742 transaction data spanning from January 2022 to January 2023 of those three tokens. Using network topology metrics, we uncover market size, average transaction of each wallet address, market density, and reachability (diameter). We also detect the presence of transaction clusters and grouping quality using the modularity metric. At last, we employ centrality calculation to identify the most important wallet address and their role in the market. We gain insight by comparing those three tokens and reveal valuable insight into patterns and relationships, network dynamics, decentralized nature, and the presence of intermediaries in the token economy market. Our objective is to uncover hidden dynamics and trace asset flows, which can provide valuable information to market participants, regulators, and innovators seeking to optimize the DeFi infrastructure, ensure stability, and mitigate risks. Leveraging the power of network analysis offers the potential to shape the future of DeFi by enhancing efficiency, security, and accessibility, thereby fostering financial inclusion and empowering individuals and businesses globally. © 2024 The Authors","Blockchain technology; Decentralized finance; Network analysis; Network science; Token economy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187250205"

Therefore, the present study aims to delineate how ChatGPT-related content garners consumer engagement on YouTube. Data from 100 YouTube videos amassing an aggregate of 65 million views on ChatGPT were extracted using three application programming interfaces (APIs), namely, VidIQ, Tubebuddy, and SocialBlade. We subsequently contrasted this dataset with data from 200 other videos produced by the same creators. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, multigroup SEM, and comparative line graphs. Employing the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) theoretical framework, our results indicate that innovative content such as ChatGPT-related videos garners more engagement than other content types from the same YouTube channels.

The free trial, as one of the new business models, has been utilized by major enterprises to advertise and promote their products in the expectation of receiving more attention from consumers, increasing the potential value of products. However, the accompanying problem of setting the number of lucky customers and free trial operation scheme properly should be handled urgently. In reality, the purchasing decision of the consumer is influenced by a variety of factors, such as reviews, trial campaigns. Meanwhile, consumers have positive and negative perceptions of products and activities, which could be transmitted to surrounding consumers. Consequently, this paper discusses the problem of the free trial policy for the electronic product by considering the positive and negative network effects. It is attempted to be solved both theoretically and empirically. The consumer network utility, demand and product profit models are proposed to solve the problem, which produces empirically testable hypotheses and Management propositions. Then, these hypotheses are tested and these management propositions are validated by utilizing real operational data from Lenovo Mall. The test and validation results indicate that there is a significant increase in the price and demand for products after the merchant taking the free trial. Moreover, although the operating costs of the merchant are increased, a much larger boost is provided by the free trial to the merchant in total profit.

Finally, cross-impact matrix multiplications applied to classification (MICMAC) is employed to differentiate the role of each barrier based on its driving and dependence power. This paper makes several theoretical contributions. First, China's hierarchical cultural value orientation encourages competition and obedience to rules, resulting in unwillingness to share knowledge, lack of coordination, and lack of error correction mechanisms. These cultural barriers hinder BDAC development. Second, organizational learning category barriers are found to be the most important in impeding BDAC development. This study also raises practitioners' awareness of the need to tackle cultural and organizational learning barriers. © 2024 The Authors","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Barrier analysis; Big data analytics capability (BDAC); Maritime industry; Mixed methods; Total interpretive structural modelling (TISM)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188716989"

HCF uses a subsidy mechanism that strongly incentivizes healthcare providers to shop for faster or cheaper internet. Telecom does not incentivize shopping. Theoretically, this predicts that HCF must achieve faster or cheaper internet than Telecom. I empirically test this question and find that Telecom subsidy recipients pay 132-179% more than HCF subsidy recipients on similar internet plans. Evidence point to Telecom's poor incentive design as the root cause. Eliminating this price gap would save American taxpayers $143 million annually.

It also shows how the application of big data analytics can put employees at great risk through institutional surveillance and other algorithmic manipulation practices such as profiling, coercion and control. Our theorizing advances the HRM and ethics literatures by offering a more expanded and nuanced view of the significant ethical challenges specific to individual HR practices. Additionally, our analysis brings ethics into the domain of HRM by problematizing the exploitation of employee information through digital technology for corporate gain. In so doing, it employs a moral principles framework to show how BDA - HRM practices can compromise employees' rights to privacy, confidentiality, transparency, and protection.

In terms of construction quality management (CQM) applications, previous works mainly took a technical perspective, and little is known about the potential of blockchain-based governance for quality opportunism. Moreover, we have seen very few successful blockchain implementations in construction practices. Stakeholders meet the trade-off between potential benefits and risks in blockchain adoption decisions. Previous works mainly focused on barrier analysis, neglecting the dynamic interactions of stakeholders' strategic behaviors on adopting blockchains. Against this backdrop, this research aims to systematically analyze blockchain impacts on CQM from a governance perspective and then investigate the owner and the main contractors' strategic behaviors (e.g., adopting blockchains in CQM or not). The agency theory was used as the theoretical lens to examine how blockchain curbs contractors' quality opportunistic behaviors as a governance mechanism. An evolutionary game theory model was developed to simulate adoption decision interactions between the owner and the main contractor. Finally, policy suggestions were highlighted for policymakers. This research could be one of the first studies examining blockchain potential to CQM from an opportunism governance perspective. Such discussions could inspire more discussions on blockchain-based governance and broaden researchers' and practitioners' understandings of blockchain impacts. The proposed policy suggestions from the equilibrium analysis could facilitate blockchain diffusion in the construction industry. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Adoption barriers; Blockchain; Construction quality management; Game theory; Opportunistic behaviors Governance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188530436"

Maintaining a balance among these categories is essential for these ecosystems’ ability to function properly. Real estate currently is largely a product of urban expansion caused by population increases and distances from primary-sector industries. The unplanned growth of urban areas can have profound consequences for local residents’ health and the environment. However, when well structured, urbanization can have a positive effect on societies’ well-being. The relationship between this expansion and its impact on real estate ecosystems is an extremely complex, subjective topic, so decision makers cannot apply just one solution when making plans. This study develops a multicriteria analysis model to support decision making processes, which provides a structured understanding of urban expansion effects on real estate ecosystems and deals with the inherent subjectivity and complexity of this decision problem. Cognitive mapping and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique were combined in a neutrosophic environment to incorporate uncertainty and produce a more realistic analysis system, thereby overcoming various limitations of previous research on urban expansion (e.g., unclear way by which relevant factors/criteria are identified in most cases, and lack of analyses dealing with the dynamics of their causal relationships). Decision makers with professional experience in relevant areas collaborated to provide essential input used to create the proposed model.

Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to explore this process by theoretically building on the social actor perspective of the firm and investigating the impact of AI-enabled B2B marketing initiatives on shareholder reaction measured by abnormal stock returns. By adopting a propensity score matching (PSM) method to generate an artificial control group of firms without adopting AI-enabled B2B marketing initiatives, we conduct an event study based on 174 sample firms (87 treatment firms and 87 matched control firms) publicly listed in the US between 2011 and 2020. The test results suggest that firms implementing AI for B2B marketing receive greater stock returns than their industry peers without AI implementation. In addition, the stock return is more remarkable for firms operating in turbulent environments and with less complex customer bases. A qualitative focus group discussion was conducted to further complement and enrich the findings.

To address these questions, we hand-collect data on 137 unicorns and examine the timing of their first patent and trademark filings, initial institutional funding, and company characteristics. Our findings indicate that all three strategic orientations – technology-first, market-first, and balanced orientation – can lead to extreme valuations. Specifically, the market-first approach emerges as the most common, with the balanced orientation most frequently associated with high growth, and the technology-first approach linked with the highest growth. Additionally, unicorns receiving seed funding before filing their first patents or trademarks tend to exhibit significantly higher median growth rates compared to those filing for intellectual property rights before securing seed funding.

Through the application of both full-sample and sub-sample methodologies, this study identifies the time-dependent interrelationships between China's artificial intelligence index (AI) and nuclear energy indicator (NUC). The quantitative analysis presents that AI's influence on nuclear energy is twofold. On one hand, AI contributes positively by acting as a catalyst and enhancing safety measures in the nuclear sector. On the other, the impact might be perceived negatively, primarily when cost-effective alternative energy sources overshadow the benefits of nuclear energy. Additionally, the positive effect of NUC on AI highlights the benefits derived from nuclear's expansive and consistent energy output, catering efficiently to AI's substantial energy demands. In essence, AI and NUC are found to be complementary, with each having the potential to propel the other forward. This reciprocity paves the way for a synergistic relationship, promising mutual benefits.

Employing a deductive-inductive approach, an exhaustive literature review combined with an in-depth, multiple case study analysis of sixteen firms provides rich insights into the digital transformation journey. Findings reveal technology, data, human capital, processes, and organization structure as key enablers alongside their critical, complementary roles for transformation. Cross-case analysis identified instances of the DT framework, uncovering three archetypes: process efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic agility. Each archetype exhibits distinct socio-technical enabler configurations and improvements to business processes, resulting in unique operational capabilities and value generation. This research provides actionable guidance for managers in leveraging socio-technical enablers to achieve successful digital transformation. It underscores the need for tailored strategies, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate.

This research seeks to elucidate the influence of Digital Entrepreneurship Education (DEE) on the interrelations among Attitude (ATT), Subjective Norms (SNs), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), Personal Innovativeness (PI), and Digital Entrepreneurship Intention (DEI) among university students in emerging nations. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) serves as the theoretical foundation for this study. The study adopts a quantitative research design, utilizing a survey questionnaire to garner information from a subset of business college students in Vietnam. A total of 334 valid responses were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), facilitating the testing of the research hypotheses. The study revealed a positive correlation between TPB constructs, PI, and DEI among university students in developing economies. However, the relationship between PBC and DEI was inversely affected by DEE. Furthermore, the study found no evidence to support the moderating effects of DEE on the relationship between ATT, SNs, PI, and DEI. This research contributes significantly to entrepreneurship studies by investigating the impact of DEE on students' inclination to embark on DE in developing countries. It extends the theoretical framework of TPB by integrating PI and underscores the importance of DEE in fostering DE. Moreover, the findings of this study hold several implications for academic administrators, policymakers, and educators.

Given the infeasibility of curbing economic growth and the limited impact of structural changes in the economy while ensuring basic well-being, green technology progress (GTP) is considered an effective path for achieving carbon reduction targets. However, existing research on how GTP affects CO2 emissions is incomplete. Therefore, we employ the spatial Durbin model to conduct an in-depth examination of the mechanism underpinning GTP regarding its impact on CO2 emissions based on 2008–2020 panel data on 30 Chinese provinces. The results show that, first, GTP has an evident “technological dividend”, which significantly inhibits local CO2 emissions; however, the spatial spillover effect of GTP is not remarkable due to insufficient technological spillover and mismatch of acceptability. Second, this paper identifies three potential transmission channels—the industrial structure, the energy structure, and energy efficiency—through which GTP effects CO2 emissions. Third, a substantial regional disparity exists in the influence of GTP on CO2 emissions, with the eastern region experiencing a notable reduction in carbon emissions due to GTP, whereas not significantly in the central and western regions. The innovation environment is a possible cause of regional heterogeneity: improving human capital and expanding the scale of technology market development have significant effects on reducing emissions through GTP, while the marginal emission reduction effect of government technology support is not significant. The findings presented in this study carry substantial implications for advancing toward low-carbon economic development and realizing the ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Green technology progress; Regional heterogeneity; Transmission mechanism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189549815"

This involves utilizing machine learning models to analyze large, multidimensional weather datasets for patterns and trends. These datasets may include variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, contributing to meteorological conditions. Furthermore, it’s imperative that classification algorithms proficiently navigate challenges such as data imbalances, where certain weather events (e.g., storms or extreme temperatures) might be underrepresented. This empirical study explores data augmentation methods to address imbalanced classes in tabular weather data in centralized and federated settings. Employing data augmentation techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique or Generative Adversarial Networks can improve the model’s accuracy in classifying rare but critical weather events. Moreover, with advancements in federated learning, machine learning models can be trained across decentralized databases, ensuring privacy and data integrity while mitigating the need for centralized data storage and processing.

In this study, we propose a single optimal tail probability by integrating trade-offs among multiple time series within an MOO framework. Mathematically, our approach links the peaks-over-threshold technique and goal programming technique by developing a set of regression functions, which represent continuous paths of possible tail areas for multiple time series, and we formulate them at the desired levels within a multiobjective optimization framework. The optimal solution is found as the minimum Chebyshev variant weighted value.

The National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data reveals a noticeable decline in the rate of driver's license acquisition among teens aged 16–20 years, with 65.4 % holding a driver's license in 2017. The percentage is 8.3 % and 8.1 % lower than in 2001 and 2009, respectively. This research compares the differences in driver's license acquisition between Millennials (teens in 2009) and their succeeding generation – Generation Z (teens in 2017) during late adolescence. It also investigates the factors that influence a teen's decision to hold a driver's license. Findings suggest that the dropped licensing rates between the two survey years can be partially explained by a generational shift in attitudes and cultural changes. Some traits of Generation Z, such as making more educational trips and growing up in a digital world, may significantly influence their decisions about obtaining a driver's license. To further explore whether Generation Z will drive less than Millennials once getting a driver's license, a multivariate analysis is conducted on licensed teens in 2009 and 2017, focusing on their driving distances on the survey day.

Our approach captures the sustainable performance of countries within the European blue economy using three different measures: value added at the factor cost of capture fisheries, shellfish aquaculture, and marine aquaculture. In the context of digitalization, four different aspects are measured, namely online selling, e-commerce sales, e-commerce turnover, e-commerce, and customer relationship management, while digital public services are measured based on digital literacies, business mobility, and key enablers. By using various empirical techniques, namely a panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) model, FGLS models, and a pooled mean group estimation (PMG) in an autoregressive distributed lag estimation method (ARDL), we provide many remarkable findings.

Nevertheless, long-term effects are more likely to be noticeable. Further, in the shape of a U curve, we also find that digitalization has nonlinear effects on marine living resources in the private and public sectors. In this study, results indicate that digitalization affects marine living resources only to a certain extent once they have reached a certain maturity level.

Therefore, this paper adopts a service ecosystem perspective and focuses on firms’ level of digitalization to observe the effects of technologies regarded as actors, as well as deriving outlooks beyond the firm level. Additionally, a multilevel view is aligned with the digital service ecosystem and supports the analysis of Industry 4.0 as sociotechnical factors in smart manufacturing technologies. Using principal component analysis (PCA), an analysis of industries was conducted to identify where the modernization of manufacturing and the contribution of digitalization show lower levels of readiness. Furthermore, the purpose of the analysis is to alert firms about opportunities to gain the most from digitalization or to enhance their level of implementation of such technologies.

The method integrates Fuzzy The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) and Fuzzy Logarithm Methodology of Additive Weights (F-LMAW) procedures. Data were collected from 20 experts representing professions such as public relations, advertising, journalism, and design through a 12-question survey. In the analysis, the F-DEMATEL procedure was initially employed to determine attitudes towards AI technologies, followed by the application of the F-LMAW procedure to assess the magnitude of AI's impact on occupational groups. Findings reveal a nuanced stance: while professionals acknowledge the necessity of AI for their work, they are unwilling to accept unemployment due to more advanced AI. This newly identified structure, termed Post-Luddism, highlights concerns over technological unemployment, particularly pronounced in professions like journalism where job prospects are limited and creative thinking is paramount. In other communication fields, the intensive use of technology mitigates fears of AI harm. However, even in journalism, there exists a propensity to perceive AI as detrimental. These insights shed light on communication professionals' apprehensions and attitudes towards AI's effects. Policymakers and stakeholders can leverage this understanding to formulate strategic measures, considering the divergent perspectives among professional groups regarding AI, towards mitigating potential unemployment risks and fostering AI-adaptive strategies. © 2024","AI; Communication; DEMATEL; Fuzzy set; LMAW; Post-Luddism","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188126566"

Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a mixed methods approach. Study 1 draws on an analysis of interviews with online marketplace users using hypothetical eBay purchases as stimuli, understanding how users conceptualize specific market signals and whether their importance varies depending on the type of purchase (high versus low involvement good). Study 2 tests hypotheses derived from signaling theory, using an eye tracking experiment. Findings: Price and photographs act as “fast and frugal” signals for inclusion in consideration sets for low involvement purchases, but consumers deem them insufficient for high involvement purchases where high-cost signals that help establish seller credibility are far more salient. Users pay relatively greater attention to costly market signals, which are beyond sellers’ direct control, for high involvement goods. Practical implications: The paper offers insights for sellers regarding the presentation of quality cues and strategies online marketplaces can employ to reduce information asymmetry. Originality/value: Drawing on and extending signaling theory, the paper introduces and confirms hypotheses for understanding users’ attention to market signals when making purchase decisions on online marketplaces.

Among the technological investment, a notable development is the applications of big data analytics (BDA), which plays a pivotal role in supporting firms' decision-making processes. Big data technologies are important factors that could help both exploratory and exploitative innovation, which could affect the efforts to combat climate change and ease the shift to green energy. However, studies that comprehensively examine BDA's impact on innovation capability and technological cycle remain scarce. This study therefore investigates the impact of BDA on innovation capability, technological cycle, and firm performance. It develops a conceptual model, validated using CB-SEM, through responses from 356 firms. It is found that both innovation capability and firm performance are significantly influenced by big data technology. This study highlights that BDA helps to address the pressing challenges of climate change mitigation and the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. However, our results are based on managerial perceptions in a single country. To enhance generalizability, future studies could employ a more objective approach and explore different contexts.

Before designing the model, the influential variables were extracted from the literature by considering the experts’ opinions. Then, the optimal values of the variables were evaluated by creating two different scenarios and three policies. The findings showed that utilizing OCR contributes to both the highest possible profit and level of customer satisfaction.

The findings consist of a comprehensive framework and a validated scale for digital skills at work. The framework entails 8 dimensions: Technology use, Cybersecurity, Content management, Communication and collaboration, Critical inquiry, Responsibility, Well-being, and Identity and development. The final scale consists of 52 items. This work enables to better understand individuals' skillsets and organizational requirements in terms of digital skills for the future of work. Both practical and research implications are discussed. © 2024 The Authors","Digital competence; Digital skills; Employability; Future of work","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185880471"

Concurrently, organizational culture emerges as a critical factor in the organizational transformation process and success. However, current literature offers sparse insights into how organizational culture affects data-driven digital transformation. To gain deeper insights, this study leverages two complementary organizational culture frameworks to examine their relationship with data-driven digital transformation. Moreover, we investigate the link between data-driven digital transformation and operational performance in a manufacturing context. Utilizing data from 317 surveys, our findings show that organizational culture significantly affects data-driven digital transformation, which consequently impacts operational performance. This study advances understanding of the critical role of organizational culture in facilitating data-driven digital transformation, addressing a previously underexplored area in Operations and Supply Chain Management literature. By employing a dual-framework approach, it provides a more nuanced comprehension of organizational culture's impact on data-driven digital transformation while clarifying the complex relationship between digital transformation and operational performance within the manufacturing sector.

Encouraging users’ switching intention to use greener delivery options such as automated courier stations (ACS) (i.e., unstaffed delivery facilities with recycling points) is vital. Employing the signaling theory, a comprehensive theoretical model was formulated to examine the latent green signals that influence users' switching intention to use ACS. A survey was conducted and gathered 612 valid responses in Singapore, and the data was analyzed through structural equation modeling. The findings reveal that the impact of green signals (i.e., green attributes, green information, green social norms, and green participation of other users) on users' switching intention is entirely mediated by the perceived green value of ACS. Additionally, the influence of perceived green value on switching intention is partially mediated by users' perceived satisfaction with ACS. This study distinguishes itself from existing literature by employing signaling theory to elucidate the effects of green factors on switching intention, thereby mitigating information asymmetry between retailers and users. In conclusion, this study enhances the existing literature on switching intention to use green ACS and provides insights into policies and management practices of last-mile logistics. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Automated courier station; Green urban logistics; Last-mile delivery; Signaling theory; Structural equation modelling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186750201"

Three online experiments were conducted to test the interaction between information relevance (interest-related vs. problem-related) and consumers' goal state (no-goal vs. other goal) in relation to purchase behavior, and tested whether this link was mediated by customer inspiration. Results showed that information relevance and goal state interacted to predict purchase behavior. Specifically, purchase behavior was highest when participants encountered problem-related information in the no-goal state and when participants encountered interest-related information in the other-goal state.

Overall, this study addresses gaps in research on the impact of housing debt on entrepreneurship and provides insights into the underlying mechanisms by revealing how housing debt amplifies risk aversion, imposes capital and credit constraints, and disproportionately affects employer entrepreneurship over self-employment entrepreneurship, as well as active entrepreneurship over passive entrepreneurship. © 2024 The Authors.

This study examines 13,026,723 SMEs in China to assess their resilience under the application of fintech in the banking sector. Our findings suggest that the epidemic reduced the probability of SME survival and increased the negative impacts of excessive distance between banks and enterprises and a banking structure dominated by large banks on SME survival. Fortunately, fintech strengthens SMEs’ resistance to risk shocks. Specifically, when banks and enterprises are farther apart and the banking structure is dominated by large banks, the positive impact of fintech on the resilience of SMEs to risk shocks becomes more evident. This suggests that fintech reduces the impact of geographical distance on the interaction between banks and enterprises and inverts the traditional notion that large banks are unsuited to serving SMEs. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Bank applications; Bank type; Bank-enterprise distance; COVID-19; Fintech; SME survival","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188095716"

This study bridges two vital gaps in urban carbon neutrality research: unraveling the causal dynamics of carbon emissions within urban networks and forecasting emission trends. This study proposes a reinforcement learning-based causal discovery algorithm, progressively deciphering the complex causal relationships in global urban emissions, and facilitating the creation of directed acyclic causal graphs. Furthermore, a hyperbolic graph neural network-based forecasting algorithm is introduced, through integrated fusion curvature to improve the information transfer between cities, for predicting global urban emission trends. A comparative analysis positions these innovative algorithms against leading methods, using emission data from thousands of cities for predictions one, five, and ten steps ahead. The experiment employs prediction error metrics, Taylor statistics, the Diebold-Mariano test, and the ablation analysis for validation. Results reveal proposed causal discovery algorithm effectively identifies the causality of carbon emissions among cities, while the forecasting algorithm leads other competing models across all prediction ranges. Based on the effectiveness of the algorithms, this study decodes the significant nature of the global urban carbon emission network, offering policy insights for collaborative carbon mitigation in cities worldwide. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence supporting carbon neutrality; Causal discovery of carbon emissions; Data-driven urban governance; Low-carbon cities; Reinforcement learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185444677"

However, investors of conventional energy assets have yet to consider the rapidly emerging AI-based assets for diversification. Owing to the rise of new categories of assets in the last two decades, which has sparked the interest of global investors to attain the most favorable outcomes, we examine volatility connectedness between AI stocks (MSFT-Microsoft, GOOG-Alphabet, AMZN-Amazon), AI tokens (AGIX-SingularityNET, OCEAN-Ocean Protocol, FET-Fetch.ai), and fossil fuel markets (WTI, BRENT, and GAS-natural gas) over the period from May 6, 2019, to July 8, 2023. We apply a novel three-dimensional framework in which we model time-domain and frequency-domain volatility spillovers at the median-, lower- and upper-quantiles in static as well as dynamic settings to achieve the objectives of this paper. We find the variation in static and dynamic connectedness between markets over time-frequencies and quantiles. Results reveal that AGIX, BRENT, FET, MSFT, and WTI are recipients, whereas AMZN, GAS, GOOG, and OCEAN are transmitters of the spillovers at the median quantile. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the short-term and long-term metrics for dynamic total connectedness might not consistently exhibit the same direction. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the short-term fluctuations predominantly influence the network's overall shock transmission, while the longer-term aspect has the potential to alter the role of a net transmitter or receiver of shocks. These findings provide portfolio managers, regulators, and policymakers with valuable information regarding portfolio adjustments, hedging, and financial stability. © 2024","AI stocks; AI tokens; Energy market; Quantile analysis; Spillover","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189534381"

Conventional methods for studying these changes, such as stated preference surveys and agent-based simulations, have limitations. Serious games offer a promising alternative, providing a controlled and engaging environment for investigating travel behavior. In our study, 200 participants, grouped into sessions of 10, engaged in a competitive serious game simulating 50 daily choices of travel mode and departure time across three automated options. Two scenarios were examined: one with recurring congestion and another with nonrecurring congestion. Automated transit had fixed schedules, while private and shared rides could adapt to a congested bottleneck. Results revealed that ridesharing dominated, reaching 60% mode share under recurring congestion, displacing transit, and a comparative equilibrium emerged between shared and private rides. In the nonrecurring congestion scenario, ridesharing dropped to 37%, and a comparable multimodal equilibrium developed. Participants rarely achieved the optimal score, attaining a maximum of 88% of its potential. This study highlights a policy paradox: unregulated AV traffic can reduce transit use, exacerbate recurring congestion, yet necessitate increased transit investment to address nonrecurring congestion, confirming the Downs-Thomson paradox. Creating appealing mass transit alternatives is imperative to ensure efficiency and sustainability in the era of automated mobility. © 2024","Reinforced Learning; Ridesharing; Serious Game; Shared Automated Vehicles; System Optimum; User Equilibrium","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189443782"

On the one hand, the standardization pathway posits that digital transformation enables servitized firms to make their service-based business model more standardized, and as a result, scalable. On the other hand, the adaptation pathway advocates that servitization enables highly digitalized firms to make their digital offerings more adaptable to heterogeneous customer needs, and as a result, customizable. We investigate which of these two paths integrates more effectively, and which one is thus likely to prevail in the long run. We use a purpose-built survey of 127 Spanish product firms to test these relationships using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), and test single- and multi-mediation models. The results corroborate the existence of both pathways, but also suggest that the standardization pathway contributes more to performance than the adaptation pathway. This is consistent with historical transitions in adoption (services existed before digital transformation) and services being dependent on digital technologies delivered remotely. These findings suggest the benefits of customization in digital servitization are lower than previous studies seem to imply, and provide important managerial implications. © 2024 The Authors","Adaptation; Digital servitization; Digital transformation; Operational performance; Servitization; Standardization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188512531"

This research examines the 25 most digitalized nations and how industrialization, natural resource extraction, and information and communication technology have contributed to GDP growth. The chosen nations' data is gathered from 2000 to 2022. The predictor elasticity of impact on the explanatory variable was estimated using the short run and long estimates of the CS-ARDL test and robust checking using the AMG test, MG test, and CCEMG estimators. According to the results, natural resources (NR) have a small but favorable impact on GDP expansion within fully digitalized markets. On the other hand, industrial development and information and communication technology (ICT) both have positive and statistically significant coefficients, which means that increasing these variables would raise GDP.

However, alongside economic progress, the issue of air pollution on a global scale has garnered widespread attention from governments and the public alike. In addressing the air pollution challenges amidst economic development, the Chinese government enacted the Air Quality Information Disclosure Policy (AQIDP) in 2012. While this policy is generally seen as an effective measure to improve the environment, its impact on microeconomic factors, particularly the digital transformation of enterprises, remains unclear. This paper employs a difference-in-differences model to study the effect of AQIDP on DT using a sample of 3347 Chinese-listed companies from 2012 to 2021. We find that AQIDP significantly inhibits DT, a result that holds even after a series of robustness tests. Our mechanism tests reveal that AQIDP weakens DT by increasing economic policy uncertainty in companies, reducing human capital, and exacerbating the crowding-out effect of environmental protection investments. Heterogeneity analysis shows that AQIDP exerts a more significant inhibitory effect on DT in cities with stricter environmental regulations, more backward industries, and companies with non-high-pollution, high-tech characteristics and non-state-owned. Further analysis reveals that although AQIDP significantly restrains DT, it leads to positive environmental effects, such as promoting pollution reduction and carbon emission reduction in companies. Based on these findings, this paper proposes policy recommendations to improve the digital transformation of companies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality information disclosure policy; Carbon emissions; Corporate digital transformation; Economic policy uncertainty","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189518863"

As one of the prevalent mobility-on-demand services, online designated driving allows car-owners booking professional drivers via mobile apps to deliver private cars (frequently with the car-owners inside) to a designated location for a fee. Online designated driving can play a crucial role in promoting road safety by providing a responsible alternative for those who cannot drive themselves due to drinking or fatigue, but there is still a lack of empirical study on its basic travel patterns. Using massive trip records of online designated driving, this study investigates the collective and individual spatio-temporal travel patterns, and reveals the spatio-temporal impact mechanism of various land-use types on online designated driving demand. Take Beijing as a case study, the results show that unlike ride-hailing trips that primarily occur during the daytime, 93.07 % of online designated driving trips occurs between 18:00 and 7:00 the next day, with the longest peak observed on Friday nights. Meanwhile, the average distance of online designated driving trips is approximately twice as long as that of ride-hailing trips (16.58 km vs. 8.48 km). The collective travel patterns of online designated driving exhibit a shrinking trend in the form of “surface-line-point” over time. Regarding individual patterns, we rigorously demonstrate that 81.55 % of high-frequency users exhibit a “fixed-destination” phenomenon, indicating a clear centripetal tendency. Furthermore, online designated driving is primarily associated with limited land-use types, revealing that it may serve specific target audiences, like travelers returning from entertainment and catering activities after consuming alcohol, or those in need of transportation for business and automotive services. These findings can contribute to refining operational practices and enhancing regulatory measures for online designated driving. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Cluster-based approach; Geographically weighted regression; Land use; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Online designated driving; Travel patterns","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189342959"

The growing number of studies have largely focused on transactions and related benefits with limited attention to emerging challenges, policies and initiatives that address the relative needs of different stakeholders. Consequently, little has been done to probe the ‘bottom-of-the-pyramid’ paradigm that underpins these assumptions. There has been inadequate endeavour to examine ways that empirical research could shed more light on these challenges and how to overcome them. To address these gaps, this study reviews the emerging literature on mobile money that explores both benefits and challenges. From our study three main themes emerge that suggest areas where challenges to the efficacy of the mobile money-financial inclusion link still appears not to have been adequately addressed by policymakers: ensuring integrity, privacy and security; addressing resource and infrastructure constraints; and integrating stakeholder benefits. Yet we suggest merely addressing these challenges does not go far enough in safeguarding the needs of local communities, as major stakeholders. Evidence from our study suggests little direct benefit to the poorer sections of local communities, only to the strata above and to elites and external stakeholders.

While parallels between BCT and the internet have been drawn, its practical application in SCM remains in an early stage, resulting in a limited body of literature and a pronounced debate with divergent perspectives concerning its impact in this SCM domain. Drawing upon the Relational View (RV) and Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV), this study aims to address this debate by investigating the role of BCT in enhancing supply chain performance. The study utilizes semi-structured interviews with 31 industry experts, followed by thematic analysis, to unveil the underlying mechanisms through which BCT influences supply chain performance. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of trust, facilitated by BCT features, in enhancing SC performance, emphasizing the interdependence of trust in technology, platforms, and SC members. Moreover, our study uncovers the substantial influence of supply chain uncertainty on the association between BCT and trust, acknowledging its pertinence in the modern business landscape. Additionally, we present a conceptual model that elucidates the relationships among BCT, trust, relational capabilities, and supply chain performance. Our qualitative investigation suggests that trust, relational capabilities, and dynamic capabilities sequentially mediate the association between BCT and supply chain performance. This research, while reaffirming the applicability of the original RV model in the context of BCT, contributes to a nuanced perspective by identifying additional associations within the relational view. Specifically, we identify knowledge sharing, effective governance, and resource complementarity as mediating factors in the relationship between relation-specific assets and relational rent. Our study provides practical advice to managers and practitioners. It stresses the need to understand how BCT impacts supply chain performance and the crucial role of trust. We also recommend nurturing relational capabilities in supply chain networks and considering the context-specific benefits of BCT, especially in uncertain environments.

Therefore, fully comprehending and investigating cultural manifestations of BIM-enabled construction organizations is critical to drive such change. Yet curiously, research in this field is scant due to the phenomenon's inherent complexity and subjective nature. Therefore, this study identifies and delineates underlying beliefs that are evident in BIM practices within a contractor construction organization by leveraging Schein's three-layered organizational culture model as the theoretical framework to analyze and interpret the primary and secondary data sourced from a case study research design. A large-scale BIM-enabled contractor organization represented the case, and the organizational BIM environment constituted the unit of analysis. Data were collected through eight in-depth semistructured interviews, direct observations, and documentation. Underlying beliefs are identified, suggesting that the company uses a combination of autocratic and participative decision-making methods, prioritizing teamwork, cooperation, and groupism over individualistic and competitive orientations. Emergent findings also reveal that employees believe in the inherent goodness of human nature and the latent capacity of individuals to govern themselves, fostering trust and autonomy within the organization. Professional behavior and conduct take a pragmatic, risk-taking, and trial-and-error approach to derive truth and reality. The organization believes in dominating the external environment rather than being submissive and considers a balance between present and future the most appropriate unit of time. Accordingly, the study enables managers to understand the shared beliefs of the employees concerning BIM and make decisions accordingly to promote and augment a harmonious alignment between cultural aspects and BIM practices. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.","BIM culture; Building information modeling (BIM); Case study; Organizational culture; Underlying beliefs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186745734"

Akin to human voices that evoke mental images in a listener even without visual cues, artificially generated voices can be intentionally designed to elicit envisioned mental representations. Drawing from prior work on sound symbolism and computational advances in speech synthesis, the authors explore how the voice of an AI-powered conversational agent (e.g., a voice assistant such as Amazon Alexa) impacts consumer perceptions and choice. Specifically, the authors examine how altering a conversational agent's digital vocal tract length (i.e., timbre) shapes consumers’ physical ascriptions of the agent and subsequent voice–product congruency evaluations. Four experiments, including a large-scale field experiment, demonstrate that increasing (decreasing) the vocal tract length promotes congruency attributions toward stereotypically masculine (feminine) products and improves advertising performance (higher click-through rates and lower costs per click). This article represents a critical first step in deepening understanding on how artificially generated voices shape the consumer experience, demonstrating how firms could enhance product congruency perceptions and advertising performance by leveraging a more theory-driven approach to voice marketing. © The Author(s) 2023.","artificial intelligence; conversational agent; sound symbolism; speech synthesis; vocal tract length; voice marketing; voice–product congruency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189529807"

The spread of third-party multi-sided platforms (TPMPs) and established actors such as Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba, has led research to overlook evaluations involving other types of multi-sided e-commerce platforms, such as content management systems (CMSs). Nevertheless, these other platforms are evolving by leaps and bounds and changing the rules of the game for e-commerce website development.

However, previous research has failed to acknowledge the potential impact of artificial intelligence on advancing renewable energy development. Drawing insights from a global dataset encompassing 63 countries over the period 2000–2019, this paper provides significant observations regarding the influence of artificial intelligence on the progress of renewable energy, by using the Instrumental Variable Generalized Method of Moments model. We also explore their asymmetric nexus, and the potential mediation effect. Moreover, this study explores the moderating role of climate finance and highlights the following interesting findings. First, artificial intelligence contributes significantly to the enhanced development of renewable energy, and this primary finding holds after two robustness tests of changing independent and dependent variables. Second, artificial intelligence has an asymmetric effect on renewable energy development, and their nexus is closer in countries with lower levels of renewable energy development. Thid, artificial intelligence works on renewable energy development through technology effect and innovation effect. Fourth, climate finance also presents direct benefits to renewable energy development; simultaneously, climate finance plays an effective moderating role in the relationship between artificial intelligence and renewable energy development.

Many digital platforms exist that allow individuals to use others’ belongings part-time. These platforms explicitly mention their green credentials, as the environmental benefits of such sharing initiatives are often taken for granted. However, there is a recent empirical literature showing evidence of the contrary. We propose a theoretical framework to analyze the economic and environmental implications of peer-to-peer sharing. We present a stylized model where a monopolist supplies a product that is suitable for rent on a sharing platform. Interestingly, we find that the existence of such a platform is typically beneficial for the monopolist, especially in the long run, when she can optimally anticipate the effects of her decisions on the sharing market. Such a scenario may not be beneficial for consumers, especially for those who rent the good rather than buy it. Moreover, the existence of the sharing platform induces higher use and (under some likely conditions) larger production levels and shorter product lifespans. The combination of these three aspects contributes to a worse environmental impact with sharing, which provides a theoretical rationale for the aforementioned empirical studies. © 2024 The Authors","Environmental externalities; Peer-to-peer sharing; Strategic lifespan; Strategic pricing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187778352"

Through asymmetrical analysis of the optimal trilemma policy choices aimed at mitigating energy volatility, we dissect energy instability into three dimensions: consumption, generation, and price volatility. Utilizing a generalized panel quantile regression approach, the study leverages an unbalanced panel dataset encompassing 184 countries over the period from 1969 to 2022. Empirical findings demonstrate that financial openness (FOP) emerges as a potent individual mitigator of energy instability, particularly at higher quantiles, outperforming both monetary policy independence (MPI) and exchange rate stability (ERS). Conversely, a closed financial system (ERS and MPI) provides partial mitigation, while a fully flexible exchange rate regime (MPI and FOP) offers comprehensive alleviation of energy instability. The results underscore the contrasting roles of financial development, which exacerbates energy volatility, as well as technology development, which acts as a mitigating factor. Importantly, the interactions of financial development and technological development with trilemma policies yield varying effects on energy instability. Policymakers should thus prioritize a fully flexible exchange rate regime to enhance energy stability, especially during times of uncertainty, and consider the intricate correlations among financial, technological, and trilemma policy factors for effective energy stability management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Energy instability; Energy security; Exchange rate stability; Financial; Monetary policy independence; Openness; Trilemma policies","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189293913"

We explore the effect of virtual influencers on consumers' normative and informational social influence, which, in turn, affects their behavioral engagement. We also investigate the relationships between virtual influencers and normative and informational social influences, using perceived interactivity and source credibility as boundary conditions. Through stratified sampling, we collected 443 responses from consumers in the hospitality industry. Structural equation modeling was utilized in AMOS 26.0 for analysis. The findings exhibit a positive association between virtual influencers and both informational and normative social influence, as well as behavioral engagement. Furthermore, this study confirms that customers' normative and informational social influence positively causes behavioral engagement. The significance of both boundary conditions is further highlighted by this research. This work improves theoretical knowledge in social impact, trust, and engagement, with implications for developing marketing strategies on online platforms.

However, limited knowledge is available on the information channels driving the adoption of the technology. Using data from 429 households, this study examines the impacts of social learning and extension services on the speed of adoption of PICS bags in Tanzania. We utilized the doubly robust multivalued inverse probability weighted regression (MIPWRA) model to estimate the impact and the Laplace regression model to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of the two information channels. The impact results indicate that social learning and extension services reduce the time to adopt PICS bags by 51 % and 49 %, respectively. Moreover, the speed at which farmers adopted the technology was faster when using the two information channels jointly (61 %) than individually. The Laplace regression model results show that the marginal impacts of the two channels are higher for the households in the upper quantiles of the distribution, compared to the lower quantiles representing the early adopters. Designing policies that account for different adopter groups (innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards) is therefore essential. © 2024 The Authors","Extension services; Improved postharvest technologies; Postharvest losses; Social learning; Tanzania","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187204630"

Despite this, retailers still lack comprehensive guidance on how to design high-quality touchpoint combinations. Existing literature on customer journey loyalty has predominantly focused on the experiential aspect, while consumer psychological factors have received less attention. Based on this, this study adopts a self-determination theory, utilizing the autonomy - competence - relatedness (ACR) model to define and examine the key attributes of CJD, and investigates the impact of these attributes on consumer behavioral loyalty. A total of 1112 respondents were examined using PLS-SEM (symmetric) and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (asymmetric) methods to confirm the consequences. Results identify CJD attributes that influence the satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, subsequently generating consumers’ re-patronage intentions and value co-creation behaviors. Moreover, there are multiple paths within the combination of ACR-oriented CJD attributes that lead to behavioral loyalty. This study marks the first attempt to apply the ACR model in the context of an omnichannel customer journey, providing noteworthy implications for practitioners seeking to enhance customer behavioral loyalty in omnichannel retailing. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","ACR model; Behavioral loyalty; Customer journey design; Omnichannel; Psychological need","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187009677"

However, there is a current paucity of empirical research focusing specifically on the antecedents of blockchain adoption in the context of these countries. This study aims to investigate the behavioral intention (BI) to use blockchain by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, incorporating subjective and objective knowledge, trust in technology, and information literacy. The proposed structural model was assessed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using the data from 275 senior managers of Iranian poultry supply chains. The results showed that effort expectancy and performance expectancy were the most influential variables in predicting the BI to use blockchain technology, respectively. Furthermore, objective knowledge had an impact on the intention to use blockchain. However, subjective knowledge was not found to have any effect. The proposed model including the moderating effects of trust in technology and information literacy showed a higher predictive power. Trust in technology moderated the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention, and information literacy moderated the relationship between technical infrastructure, as one of the facilitating conditions, and behavioral intention.

However, extant literature that used sufficient logic has fallen short in explaining this phenomenon as the findings are insufficient to explain the necessary conditions that activate users' intention and actual usage. The purpose of this study is to identify the enablers (must-have factors) and enhancers (should-have factors) of consumers' intention and actual use of mobile sharing economy. A must-have factor is needed to initialize the effect of independent variables while a should-have factor enhances the effect. Drawing from the extended valence framework, a combined SEM-ANN-NCA analysis is used to examine users' actual adoption of MSE. The application of the “sufficiency logic” and “necessity logic” and the AI and machine learning-based ANN approach enables us to ascertain the linear-nonlinear relationships and the enablers and enhancers in mobile sharing economy. The findings show that mobile ease of use is a sufficient and necessary condition for mobile usefulness while trust is a sufficient and necessary condition for epistemic benefit. Mobile usefulness and trust are the sufficient and necessary conditions for behavioral intention while behavioral intention is the sufficient and necessary condition for actual use. Trust is a sufficient but unnecessary condition for convenience and psychological risk. Epistemic benefit and psychological risk are sufficient but not necessary conditions for behavioral intention. Education is a sufficient but not necessary condition for actual use. The study has provided important new practical and theoretical insights to MSE service providers, operators, users and scholars. © 2023","Convenience; Epistemic benefit; Mobile sharing economy; Necessary condition analysis (NCA); Perceived risks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185194303"

We conceptualize fine-grained types of product component reuse based on whether product components are reused for the first time or multiple times and are introduced internally or externally. Our baseline hypothesis is that firms' boundary-spanning search for technology will increase their generation of new product innovations. Then, we hypothesize that when firms first reuse product components, the reuse of internally introduced product components will generate more new product innovations than the reuse of externally introduced product components; when firms reuse product components multiple times, the reuse of externally introduced product components will generate more new product innovations than the reuse of internally introduced product components. For the interplay between two types of experiences—the technological search and product component reuse—we propose that when firms reuse their own product components for the first time, the positive effect of boundary-spanning search on new product innovations will weaken; when firms reuse other firms' product components multiple times, the positive effect of boundary-spanning search on new product innovations will be strengthened. We corroborate our hypotheses using data on patents of smartphone manufacturing firms and components of smartphone devices introduced worldwide from 2006 to 2018. We find broad support for our hypotheses. Our findings imply that firms' product component reuses have multifaceted effects on new product innovations and that the attentional coordination of firms' experiences across technology search and product component reuse is critical in shaping new product innovations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Component reuse; New product innovation; Recombination; Smartphone industry; Technology search","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185806701"

Number of followers (i.e., those who follow creators) and number of followees (i.e., those who are followed by creators) serve as cues to infer creators' influence. However, a cue of creators' actual influence is under-addressed and its effect on social media engagement remains to be explored. This research fills the gap in the literature by investigating how the cue of creators' actual influence (i.e., follower-followee comparison) may affect followers' engagement behavior. The study further examines the moderation effects of media-, topic-, and creator-related factors. The present work leverages a novel dataset provided by NetEase Cloud Music. The study employs a zero-inflated negative binomial model to perform the empirical analysis.

Some highly influential streamers may choose whether and how to cooperate with firms. This study considers two sales strategies that streamers might choose: a non-selective sales (NS) strategy and a selective sales (S) strategy. Under the NS strategy, streamers always choose to sell firms' products, while under the S strategy, streamers only cooperate with firms whose products closely fit consumers' preference. Considering the streamer's sales effort during a live stream and two key characteristics—influence and product-matching reliability—this study employs a Stackelberg game model to investigate the streamer's sales strategy preference and the impact of the streamer's characteristics. The study also explores conflict between the firm and the streamer in selecting the sales strategy. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates that the streamer makes more sales effort to increase demand during the live stream under the NS strategy than under the S strategy. The streamer with high influence or high product-matching reliability should adopt the S strategy, whereas the streamer with less influence and product-matching reliability will likely prefer the NS strategy. We also identify two Pareto zones, showing that the streamer and firm prefer the same sales strategy (either NS or S) in some cases.

This chapter discusses the challenges and different strategies to increase skill development for the future workforce. Methodology. Multiple sources on the topic were studied and reviewed in this chapter. The idea of skill and its development is discussed in the literature review. Findings. Different nations’ governments have promoted human capital development by providing up-skilling and retraining programs to balance supply and demand. Skills gaps need to be brought to the attention of stakeholders, such as governments, businesses, and the educational system. Teachers, employers, and other stakeholders need to develop strategies and action plans to ensure that the skills gaps are appropriately identified and adequately addressed. These initiatives must be developed with input from various stakeholders. Practical Implications. The research results would inform the curriculum, incorporating skill development processes tailored to various scenarios. These findings would aid business organisations in crafting skill development programs that address identified skill gaps. Challenges in skill development would be taken into account during course development, and relevant teaching– learning materials would be created. Key stakeholders, such as accrediting organisations, employers, and students, should exert more influence on academic institutions to prioritise societal demands for economic development.

The emergence of the digital economy injected renewed vitality into enterprise innovation. However, existing studies have predominantly concentrated on the digital transformation intrinsic to enterprises, neglecting the impact of partners' digital transition on enterprises’ innovation performance. From the perspective of supply chain spillovers, this study evaluates the influence of digital transitions in upstream and downstream enterprises on the innovation activities of midstream enterprises. The results show that the digital transformation of enterprises within the supply chain exhibits a transmission effect, and the digital transformation of upstream and downstream enterprises significantly promotes the innovation performance of midstream enterprises. The mechanistic analysis revealed that the digital transformation of upstream and downstream enterprises mainly enhances the resilience of the supply chain by improving its efficiency, optimizing the match between supply and demand, and stabilizing the relationship between supply and demand, thus promoting the innovation level of midstream enterprises. Further analysis shows that improvements in the innovation output of midstream enterprises are reflected in the quality of innovation. When the upstream and downstream firms belong to the same industry, the supply chain spillover effect of digital transformation is more evident, and simultaneously, the digital collaboration of the supply chain can promote the innovation of midstream enterprises. © 2024 The Author(s)","Digital transformation; Enterprise innovation; Supply chain spillover","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188988357"

This study investigates the effects and mechanisms of digital transformation on firm innovation investment from the perspective of total factor productivity, using a sample of manufacturing companies listed on the A-share market in China from 2012 to 2021. The following three main findings were obtained. First, results of both fixed- and random-effects regression methods revealed that digital transformation significantly promotes firms’ innovation investment. This conclusion remains robust after controlling for endogeneity issues using the instrumental variable method and replacing the explanatory variable measurement methods. Second, stepwise regression analysis revealed a negative mediating mechanism of total factor productivity (TFP) in the impact of digital transformation on the level of firm innovation investment. The main reason for this is that an improvement in TFP intensifies the competition for capital and labor input between the production and innovation departments. Third, the group regression for heterogeneity analysis found that the overall effect of digital transformation on firm innovation investment is significantly positive in groups with low financing constraints and high human capital, but not significant in groups with high financing constraints and low human capital. Moreover, the negative mediating mechanism of TFP is significantly valid in all groups, further validating the competition between the production and innovation departments for capital and labor input.

Consequently, the pursuit of acquiring high-quality products at a reduced cost has become a significant concern for countries. The primary objective of this research is to leverage data mining and data intelligence techniques to enhance and refine the production process of texturized yarn by developing an intelligent operating guide that enables the adjustment of production process parameters in the texturized yarn manufacturing process, based on the specifications of raw materials. Design/methodology/approach: This research undertook a systematic literature review to explore the various factors that influence yarn quality. Data mining techniques, including deep learning, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine and VOTE, were employed to identify the most crucial factors. Subsequently, an executive and dynamic guide was developed utilizing data intelligence tools such as Power BI (Business Intelligence). The proposed model was then applied to the production process of a textile company in Iran 2020 to 2021. Findings: The results of this research highlight that the production process parameters exert a more significant influence on texturized yarn quality than the characteristics of raw materials. The executive production guide was designed by selecting the optimal combination of production process parameters, namely draw ratio, D/Y and primary temperature, with the incorporation of limiting indexes derived from the raw material characteristics to predict tenacity and elongation. Originality/value: This paper contributes by introducing a novel method for creating a dynamic guide. An intelligent and dynamic guide for tenacity and elongation in texturized yarn production was proposed, boasting an approximate accuracy rate of 80%.

It plays a critical role in improving the management of natural resource rents by promoting transparency, accountability, and responsible governance. However, empirical evidence on the impact of digital government on natural resource rents is lacking. To plug this vacuum into the literature, the analysis tries to study the impact of digital government on natural resource rent from 2003 to 2021 by collecting data across many economies and dividing the data into five samples: Global, Asian, American, European, and African. For empirical analysis, the study utilizes the 2SLS and GMM techniques. The analysis's main findings indicate that digital government escalates natural resource rent globally in Asia, America, and Europe. Likewise, human capital and financial development also help to advance natural resource rent. Further, the trade causes the natural resource rent to rise globally in Asia, America, Europe, and the African model, while technology promotes natural resource rent in Global, American, and European models. In contrast, external conflict causes the natural resource rent to fall globally in America and Europe. From these findings, the study infers that policymakers should increase the role of digitalization in governance-related activities, particularly in the natural resource sector. © 2024","Digital government; Natural resource sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188804355"

With its characteristics of high efficiency, high productivity, and low emissions, it plays a significant role in the low-carbon transition of the energy market (EM). This study scientifically evaluates the integration level between urban digital economy and energy market (DEI) using panel data from 281 Chinese cities between 2011 and 2020. The Dagum Gini coefficient, variance decomposition, and QAP methods are employed to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and reveal the sources and formation mechanism of integration differences. The findings are as follows: ①The integration level between China's urban digital economy and energy market exhibits an apparent upward trend, but significant differences exist among the four major regions. ②Inter-regional disparities serve as the primary spatial source of the integration differences between China's urban digital economy and energy market. ③The difference in integration efficiency is the primary structural source of the integration differences, with the western and northeastern regions experiencing the greatest impact. ④The four structural-layer factors, namely integration efficiency, integration foundation, integration structure, and integration scale, contribute positively to integration differences, with the effect intensity decreasing in sequence. Accordingly, several policy implications derive. These include implementing targeted measures to address inter-regional disparities and promote balanced integration across different region, efforts to enhance integration efficiency in underperforming regions, and prioritizing investment in infrastructure to enhance the overall integration level. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the integrated development between China's urban DE and EM, offering guidance for countries seeking to optimize DE and EM. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Digital economy; Energy market; Integration development; QAP; Spatial variations; Structural sources","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189546446"

To address this issue, this study investigates both the effect of industrial robot adoption on carbon dioxide emissions, as well as the mechanism through which this effect is transmitted using data from OECD and BRICS countries spanning from 1993 to 2015. In particular, we present three possible influence mechanisms of industrial robots on carbon dioxide emissions, namely, the economic growth effect, technological progress effect, and structural transformation effect. Employing the STIRPAT and environmental Kuznets curve models, we estimate the negative and significant effects of industrial robot adoption on carbon dioxide emissions, analyze their effect under different conditional distributions and in different countries, and verify the effect channels of industrial robots on carbon dioxide emissions using the stepwise regression method and the bootstrap method. The empirical results indicate that the increased use of industrial robots can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly at higher quantiles of emissions. Moreover, the negative impacts of industrial robot adoption on carbon dioxide emissions are more pronounced in OECD, developed, and European and American countries compared to BRICS, developing, and non-European and American countries. Finally, the adoption of industrial robots primarily achieves its impact on carbon dioxide emissions through the facilitation of an economic growth effect.

Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was first conducted to identify barriers to CSR performance. After that, construction professionals were invited to validate the appropriateness of the obstacles. The discussion allowed the establishment of a list of barriers to CSR performance and their corresponding categories. Data collected from the survey were then analyzed to prioritize the importance of these barriers by the fuzzy DEMATEL-based ANP (DANP) technique. Findings: The findings presented 16 barriers to CSR, which were categorized into four clusters. The fuzzy DANP analysis showed that strategic vision is the most crucial cluster, followed by the measurement system, stakeholder perspective and scarce resources. Among the sixteen barriers examined, lack of awareness, knowledge and information of CSR; low priority of CSR; lack of metrics to quantify CSR benefits; lack of guidelines and coherent strategies; and lack of CSR enforcement mechanism are the five most crucial barriers. Originality/value: This study is one of the first that proposes a comprehensive model to prioritize barriers to CSR performance of contractors considering their interrelationships. It provides construction stakeholders with a framework for understanding the linkage between the barriers and CSR framework under the umbrella of stakeholder theory. Thus, the findings might assist construction practitioners and academics in fostering the success of CSR implementation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Barrier; Construction; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Fuzzy DEMATEL-Based ANP (DANP)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143443633"

There is a growing consumer preference for products derived from renewable resources, particularly non-wood forest products (NWFPs). The process of making purchasing decisions for NWFPs is complex and influenced by various criteria. As the demand for NWFPs continues to rise, it becomes imperative to establish a comprehensive decision-making framework that examines the most significant criteria affecting consumers' purchasing decisions. This study proposes an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based decision-making framework for identifying and analyzing the key criteria influencing consumers’ decisions when purchasing NWFPs. In light of the aim, six main criteria and thirty subcriteria are determined. A three-level hierarchical model is devised to systematically evaluate the identified criteria. The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy AHP method is employed to assign weights to the criteria. According to the results, “health aspects” is the most significant main criterion. The five most important subcriteria are determined as “health benefits and harmlessness”, “absence of additives and preservatives”, “product price”, “quality standard and guarantee”, and “nutritional content and value”.

We found that corporate digital transformation significantly reduces equity financing costs; this conclusion still holds after a series of robustness tests. Corporate digital transformation improves investors' expectations by increasing their future earnings and lowering their risk levels. As a result, to share firms’ growth potential, investors will lower the cost of equity. Moreover, by constructing the lifecycle model, we explored the heterogeneity condition from a time-dynamic perspective and found the inhibiting effect is more pronounced in firms staying in growth and mature stages. Moderating effect analysis shows that marketization and investor sentiment can positively moderate the relationship between the two.

This research delves deep into the interplay of parasocial interaction, vicarious expression, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), and the bandwagon effect, all converging towards influencing online purchase intention. Through two controlled quasi-experiments—with 232 participants in Study 1 and 252 in Study 2—we offer a fresh perspective rooted in parasocial relationship theory. Study 1 delineates how parasocial interactions heighten the impact of vicarious expressions, leading to amplified bandwagon effect and pronounced eWOM. The study further corroborates the mediating role of vicarious expression between parasocial interaction and the bandwagon effect. Study 2 sheds light on the cyclical nature of this process, illustrating that eWOM, in turn, reinforces the bandwagon effect, driving online purchase intention. These findings underscore the potent influence of parasocial interactions on online purchasing behaviors, suggesting that brands can strategically leverage such interactions to enhance eWOM and harness the bandwagon effect. Moreover, recognizing the cyclical reinforcement between eWOM and the bandwagon effect offers marketers a unique opportunity to amplify and sustain online purchase momentum. © 2024 The Authors","Bandwagon effect; Electronic word of mouth; eWOM; Parasocial interaction; Vicarious expression","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184014478"

At the macro level, it also leads to industrial development and economic growth. Purpose: The research is to identify the types of skills required for increasing the probability of employability of labour. It also aims to define the challenges and opportunities in skill development to drive change. Need of the Study: Studying opportunities and challenges for skill development in developing economies is essential for achieving sustainable economic growth, reducing poverty, increasing employment opportunities, and promoting global competitiveness. Research Methodology: Some skills are recognised through research that has been published to determine the skill set needed to increase labour productivity. To draw lessons, some skill development initiatives by various companies are also identified and presented in case studies. Additionally, several government programs are available to assess the possibilities and prospects for skill development in the Indian market. Practical Implications: The research will be valuable in micro and macro decision making. At the micro level, research is advantageous for a business person to initiate the skill development of its employees by using government schemes. Nations other than India can understand the policy framework for skill development. Findings: The term ‘skilling’ has become fashionable. Due to the need for skillbased earnings data, only some studies examine the return on skill (ROS) of the labour market. Skill development plays a significant role in bringing change at the micro and macro levels. Hence it is necessary to exploit all opportunities for skill development. © 2024 by Mukul, Sanjay Taneja, Ercan Özen and Neha Bansal.","business; developing; economy; employment; planning; Skill development","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189890005"

Manufacturing organizations have recently undergone substantial transformation due to Industry 4.0 technologies. Hence, to successfully deploy and embed Industry 4.0 technologies in their organizational operations and practices, businesses must assess their adoption readiness. For this purpose, a multi-dimensional analytical indicator methodology has been developed to measure Industry 4.0 maturity and preparedness.

The enhancement of digital transformation performance in manufacturing enterprises has emerged as a prominent topic of interest for both corporate entities and the academic community. Drawing upon the theoretical framework of the TOE model, this article presents a comprehensive analytical framework aimed at understanding the performance of digital transformation in manufacturing enterprises. By assessing a sample of 180 manufacturing enterprises currently undergoing digital transformation, this study employs the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA) methodology to study the interrelated effects and strategic choices pertaining to technology, organizational structure, and environmental conditions, all of which contribute to the improvement of digital transformation performance in manufacturing enterprises. The findings of the research indicate the following: (1) The attainment of high performance in digital transformation in manufacturing enterprises does not solely rely on a single condition, whether it pertains to the optimization of manufacturing processes or the development of new products. (2) High performance in digital transformation is the result of multiple interacting factors. Various causal configurations, such as “organization-environment oriented”, “all-factor driven”, and “technology-environment oriented”, which have the characteristics of “multiple concurrency” and “different paths leading to the same goal.” (3) In comparison, achieving high performance in manufacturing process optimization requires a higher degree of complexity than attaining high performance in new product development. Additionally, it is challenging to achieve high performance in new product development with a sole reliance on a single technological foundation and external environmental support. These research conclusions contribute to the existing body of knowledge on digital transformation performance, enhancing our understanding of the complex factors that underlie high performance in digital transformation in manufacturing enterprises. Importantly, they hold practical significance in improving the performance of digital transformation in the manufacturing sector. © 2024 The Authors","Digital transformation; Fs/QCA; Performance; TOE framework","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189533547"

To fill this gap, we took the online environmental project Ant Forest as an example and constructed a multi-agent simulation model incorporating members' gratification types, social network connectivity, and external incentives. Then, we analyzed the decision-making characteristics of groups participating in OLGB. The results showed that: (1) When the ratio of members seeking entertainment, social, and achievement gratifications was 3:3:4, more people chose to accept OLGB and it has the most stable decision status; (2) Under low network connectivity, the group was more inclined to accept OLGB, and the decision status was more stable; (3) When high-intensity financial incentives and medium-intensity non-financial incentives were coupled, the number of people choosing OLGB was the largest, and the decision-making status was the most stable.

However, there remains a gap in the understanding the extent and mechanisms through which the establishment of economic growth targets influences firms' pollution emissions. Addressing this gap, we construct datasets that encapsulate both micro-level and macro-level perspectives to examine the impact of economic growth targets on corporate pollution. We find that an increase in economic growth targets leads to a significant rise in pollution emissions from industrial firms. To address potential endogeneity issues, we employ various strategies, and our results remain robust across these different approaches. We then estimate the heterogeneous impact of economic growth targets and demonstrate that the positive effect of these targets on pollution emissions tends to be less pronounced for firms situated in cities governed by female mayors. Conversely, the effect appears more pronounced for firms located in the western region, those operating in cities led by older mayors, and those in cities where mayors have lower levels of education. Finally, we explore potential mechanisms through which economic growth targets impact corporate pollution. Our results show that at the firm level, a higher economic growth target primarily leads to increased pollution emissions from enterprises by reducing firms' investment in pollution control. At the city level, an elevation in economic growth targets predominantly results in escalated enterprise-related pollution, chiefly due to its hindrance of urban green innovation, reduction in fiscal allocations for science and technology, and a decrease in educational fiscal outlays. These empirical findings strongly advocate for the implementation of measures aimed at dissuading prefecture-level city governments from formulating excessively ambitious economic growth targets, as a viable strategy for mitigating pollution stemming from manufacturing firms in developing nations. In view of this, our research is conducive to advancing the process of building a sustainable development path in China and providing reliable solutions to global ecological challenges. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Economic growth targets; Innovation; Political promotion; Pollution emissions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189540472"

The emergence of marital apps can be traced back to approximately ten years ago. However, there exists a significant level of uncertainty and mixed feelings regarding the acceptance and utilisation of these apps. Previous research has predominantly concentrated on interconnected domains such as online dating, social networking, and the influence of technology on relationships. However, there exists a noticeable dearth of extensive scholarly investigations that exclusively centre on marital applications. Expanding upon the theoretical framework of the Uses and Gratification theory, researchers did a longitudinal analysis over three distinct time periods, with a total of 477, 456, and 429 participants. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence purchase motivation, adoption suggestion, and user happiness within the context of marital applications. The results obtained from the structural equation modelling indicate that convenience gratification, information gratification, and personal-identity gratification are significant predictors of the purchase motive for marital applications. Furthermore, the findings from the first wave of data analysis provide confirmation of the influential role played by community orientation inside these applications. The results of the second wave of data analysis provide confirmation of the influential role played by the moderators, innovativeness and privacy concerns in enhancing consumers' intention to adopt and advocate a certain product or service. Ultimately, the results of wave 3 validate the significance of moderating variable, user experience, in augmenting user pleasure with these applications. The study elaborates that managers must acknowledge the changing dynamics in society norms and desires, as the younger generation progressively adopts technology to seek romantic partners. Furthermore, it is crucial to have efficient marketing techniques that align with the cultural intricacies of various communities in India. This study contributes to the comprehensive comprehension of consumer behaviour within the context of marital applications, providing exciting theoretical and managerial implications for the adoption and deployment of these technologies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Longitudinal study; Matrimonial apps; Purchase motivation; Technology adoption; Use and gratification theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183092431"

The local government encourages manufacturers to adopt low-carbon technology for better realizing carbon neutrality and sustainable achievement by environmental regulations. However, it is not enough to only rely on governmental regulation. The supervision of the media on LCT adoption is also indispensable. Therefore, the multi-participants’ supervision strategy on LCT is proposed to fill the gap, consisting of the government, manufacturer, and media. To help manufacturers perform low-carbon production, an evolutionary game model is formulated to investigate the strategic behaviors of involved tripartite participants. We disclose the evolution process of the manufacturer's LCT adoption decision under joint supervision-the government and media. Besides, the detailed influences of parameters such as the cost of LCT and carbon emission ratio on participants' strategies are explored to help better understand the involved participants' behaviors. The numerical results show that the manufacturer is more likely to adopt LCT under joint supervision. When the manufacturer could gain more benefits by adopting LCT, they would always choose to employ LCT even if there is no stimulus from the government and media.

This phenomenon raises questions about the necessity of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives for vulnerable organizations such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they may deprioritize CSR to focus on surviving. The review of previous studies highlighted a limited theoretical understanding of CSR that existed during such challenging economic periods. This study aims to bridge this research gap by investigating the driving forces that motivate construction SMEs to implement CSR during economic uncertainty. Through a combination of literature review, semi-structured interviews, and hybrid fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-Analytic Network Process methods, 13 drivers for CSR were identified and categorized into four clusters: human resources benefit, market pressure, organizational reputation, and financial benefit. Human resources benefit was recognized as the most influential cluster, and employee commitment and loyalty was the most critical CSR driver.

Consumers commonly post opinions and accounts of their experiences with brands on social media. Such consumer-generated content may or may not overlap with content desired by brand managers. Drawing from “The medium is the message” paradigm, this study text-mines user narratives on Twitter1 to shed light on the role of social media in shaping public images of brands with heritage through the lens of the stereotype content model. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a data set of almost 80,000 unique tweets on 12 brands across six categories, compares brands high versus low in heritage and combines dictionary-based content analysis with sentiment analysis. Findings: The results indicate that both user-generated content and sentiment are significantly more positive for brands low rather than high in heritage. Regarding warmth, consumers use significantly more positive words on sociability and fewer negative words on morality for brands low rather than high in heritage. Regarding competence, tweets include more positive words on assertiveness and ability for low-heritage brands. Finally, overall sentiment is more positive for brands low rather than high in heritage. Practical implications: Important from co-creation and integrated marketing communication perspectives, the findings provide brand managers with actionable insights on how to more effectively use social media. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is among the first to examine user-generated content in a brand heritage context. It demonstrates that heritage brands, with their longevity and strong links to the past, need to be aware of how contemporary social media can detract from their image. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Brand co-creation; Brand heritage; Content analysis; Data mining; Sentiment; Sentiment analysis; Stereotype content; Twitter; User generated content","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186202087"

Addressing this issue, this study utilizes a dataset spanning from 2006 to 2020, encompassing 278 Chinese cities, to examine the impact and mechanisms of sustainable finance on HP management. This research innovatively constructs a Sustainable Finance Index and employs fixed effects models, mediation effect models, and spatial Durbin models for comprehensive empirical analysis. The findings indicate a significant negative relationship between sustainable finance and HP, with pronounced effects in cities experiencing severe haze, cities in the central and eastern regions of China, and non-provincial boundary cities. Mechanism analysis reveals that sustainable finance curtails urban haze formation through the optimization of energy consumption structure, enhancement of energy efficiency, and advancement of environmental technologies. This is primarily achieved through pollution source reduction and innovation effects. Additionally, the study uncovers a spatial spillover effect of sustainable finance in mitigating HP, peaking within a 500-km radius. This research not only provides new insights into the role of sustainable finance in the construction of ecological civilization but also offers empirical support for policymakers and stakeholders in formulating clean production policies, enhancing both the academic dialogue and practical policymaking in environmental management and sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Energy consumption structure; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology advancement; Haze pollution; Sustainable finance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188669942"

Therefore, this paper analyzed the co-movement effect of managers' psychological factors on the BIM adoption decisions from the perspective of managers' perceptions. The purpose is to let managers have a deep understanding of their BIM adoption decisions, and put forward targeted suggestions for the AEC industry to promote the adoption of BIM by SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 192 managers in SMEs collected by the questionnaire were used in a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Due to the limitations of fsQCA in making the best use of the data used, as a complement to fsQCA, necessary conditions analysis (NCA) was used to analyze the extent to which necessary conditions influenced the outcome. Findings: (1) NCA analysis shows that high perceived resource availability (PRA) and high performance expectancy (PE) are necessary conditions for high BIM adoption intention (AI). (2) fsQCA analysis shows that high PE is the single core condition for high AI. fsQCA analysis identifies three configurations of managers' psychological factors, reflecting three types of managers' decision preferences, namely benefit preference, loss aversion and risk avoidance, respectively. Different decision preferences may lead to different BIM adoption strategies, such as full in-house use, partial in-house/outsourcing and full outsourcing of BIM processes. (3) High perceived risk (PR) and low perceived business value of BIM (PBV) are the core conditions for low AI. Originality/value: This paper expands on the application of fsQCA to context of BIM adoption decisions. Based on the results of fsQCA analysis, this paper also establishes the relationship between managers' decision-making psychology and BIM adoption strategy choice and analyzes the impact of different decision biases on BIM adoption strategy choice.

The position of DPs is impacted by the regulations. However, emerging economies often lack the regulatory environment to support DPs. This paper aims to explore the regulatory developments for DPs using the multi-level perspective (MLP). Design/methodology/approach: The paper explores regulatory developments of ride-hailing platforms (RHPs) in India and their impacts. This study uses qualitative interview data from platform representatives, bureaucrats, drivers, experts and policy documents. Findings: Regulatory developments in the ride-hailing space cannot be explained as a linear progression. The static institutional assumptions, especially without considering the multi-actors and multi-levels in policy formulation, do not serve associated actors adequately in different times and spaces. The RHPs regulations must consider the perspective of new RHPs and the support available to them. Non-consideration of short- and long-term perspectives of RHPs may have unequal outcomes for established and new RHPs. Research limitations/implications: This research has implications for the digital economy regulatory ecosystem, DPs and implications for policymakers. Though the data from legal documents and qualitative interviews is adequate, transactional data from the RHPs and interviews with judiciary actors would have been insightful. Practical implications: The study provides insights into critical aspects of regulatory evolution, governance and regulatory impact on the DPs’ ecosystem. The right balance of regulations according to the business models of DPs allows DPs to have space for growth and development of the platform ecosystem. Social implications: This research shows the interactions in the digital space and how regulations can impact various actors. A balanced policy can guide the paths of DPs to have equal opportunities. Originality/value: DP regulations have a complex structure.

Construction incentivisation (CI) is one of the long-standing principles adopted to enhance project performance. There is a paucity of studies concerning CI to improve digital technology applications. Thus, this research investigated the relevance and perceived hindrances that may hinder the implementation of CI from promoting digital technologies and proffer ways to improve digital technology applications in the construction sector. Design/methodology/approach: In Nigeria’s context, this research is exploratory. Twenty-four semi-structured virtual interviews were conducted in Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria, with knowledgeable participants that indicated interest and were interviewed. The engaged interviewees were drawn from government agencies, academicians in construction consultancy, Internet and communication technology experts, construction contracting firms and construction consulting firms. The collected data were coded and analysed through a thematic method. Findings: Digitalisation of the industry via CI may face some hindrances. The perceived issues that may hinder CI implementation were classified into most severe, severe and fairly severe in Nigeria’s construction industry context. Findings proffer feasible policy solutions that can mitigate these issues and improve digital technology applications in the industry via the CI. Research limitations/implications: This study covered the relevance and perceived issues that may hinder the implementation of the CI to improve digital technology applications in the industry. Also, the study proffers policy solutions to enhance digital technology applications in the industry via the CI concept. Practical implications: Findings from this research will support and offer a valuable understanding of the relevance of the “incentivisation concept” to improve digital technology applications in the Nigerian-built environment. Other developing countries with low applications of digital technology in construction may consider the suggested policy solutions from this research.

The supply chain management of perishable products becomes complex and challenging due to the inclusion of its perishability dynamics. Quality is the main factor that governs the buying or discarding of perishable products by consumers. Therefore, the main aim of this research work is to develop an accurate and efficient image processing model for the classification of the product (Tomato) based on its quality for managing the supply chain. There are three novelties in this research work. A four-stage supply chain architecture integrated with the image processing system at mandi, and warehouses is proposed (First). This image processing system is developed in two stages. In stage I, the acquired images of tomato during its life cycle are labelled with the help of machine learning algorithms (Second). This labelled data is used in stage II for the development of a classification model to segregate the product into various grades. For this, an optimized architecture of seven-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is developed followed by optimization of its hyperparameters simultaneously using Design of Experiments (DOE) technique (Third). The optimized CNN model achieved maximum accuracy of 88.40% and reported an execution time of 7 min. Further, the results of standard hyperparameter optimization techniques like Grid search, Random search, Bayesian, and Hyperband are compared with the proposed DOE technique on the optimized CNN architecture. The work done in this paper enables the supply chain managers to take accurate and rapid decisions for pricing, procurement, storage, and transportation at various stages of the supply chain leading to Industry 4.0. This will result in reduced post-harvest losses and simultaneously achieve the benefits across social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainability leading to better supply chain management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Hyperparameters; Image processing; Industry 4.0; Quality; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189040635"

Real estate valuation, as a fully interconnected field with the AEC industry, can benefit from 3D technical achievements in BIM technologies. Some studies have attempted to use BIM for real estate valuation procedures. However, there is still a limited understanding of appropriate mechanisms to utilize BIM for valuation purposes and the consequent impact that BIM can have on decreasing the existing uncertainties in the valuation methods. Therefore, the paper aims to analyze the literature on BIM for real estate valuation practices. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a systematic review to analyze existing utilizations of BIM for real estate valuation practices, discovers the challenges, limitations and gaps of the current applications and presents potential domains for future investigations. Research was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar databases to find relevant references that could contribute to the study. A total of 52 publications including journal papers, conference papers and proceedings, book chapters and PhD and master's theses were identified and thoroughly reviewed. There was no limitation on the starting date of research, but the end date was May 2022. Findings: Four domains of application have been identified: (1) developing machine learning-based valuation models using the variables that could directly be captured through BIM and industry foundation classes (IFC) data instances of building objects and their attributes; (2) evaluating the capacity of 3D factors extractable from BIM and 3D GIS in increasing the accuracy of existing valuation models; (3) employing BIM for accurate estimation of components of cost approach-based valuation practices; and (4) extraction of useful visual features for real estate valuation from BIM representations instead of 2D images through deep learning and computer vision.

This article aims to analyze PP in the digital transformation (DT) process to determine how it is affected by technostress (TS) and work engagement (WE), two concepts that seem to be forces opposing PP. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use data from a questionnaire addressed to personnel in two organizations (public and private). The analysis applies partial least squares technique to the 505 valid responses obtained from these organizations. This analysis is based not on representativeness but on uniqueness. Findings: The results suggest a positive, significant relationship between DT and PP. This article integrates DT and its effects on aspects of people's health, PP and WE. The model thus includes interactions of technology with human elements. In both business and administrative environments, PP is key to optimizing resources and survival of organizations. Research limitations/implications: DT processes are different and complex because every organization is different. The authors recommend expanding this study to other sectors in both spheres, public and private. Aligning the objectives of the institutions for aid with DT is also quite complicated.

In such systems, automated decision-making and decentralized or distributed control structures are combined. Such control structures reduce the complexity of decision-making, require less computational effort, and are therefore faster, reducing the risk that changes during decision-making render the solution invalid. These benefits of self-organizing systems are of interest to many practitioners involved in solving real-world problems in the logistics sector. This study, therefore, identifies and classifies research related to self-organizing logistics (SOL) with a focus on transportation. SOL is an interdisciplinary study across many domains and relates to other concepts, such as agent-based systems, autonomous control, and decentral systems. Yet, few papers directly identify this as self-organization. Hence, we add to the existing literature by conducting a systematic literature review that provides insight into the field of SOL. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold: (i) based on the findings from the literature review, we identify and synthesize 15 characteristics of SOL in a typology, and (ii) we present a two-dimensional SOL framework alongside the axes of autonomy and cooperativity to position and contrast the broad range of literature, thereby creating order in the field of SOL and revealing promising research directions. © 2023 The Authors.

This study raises the following research questions: How do agri-food exporting companies view sustainability marketing and its practical application? To which aspects of their sustainable marketing system do such companies attach greater or lesser importance? Using a constructive research approach, a study was carried out by conducting interviews with experts in the sector, as well as with managers from agrifood export companies. On the basis of such interviews, an analytical framework as well as an accessible management tool comprising 17 variables (grouped into 6 sets) are proposed to support the management of sustainability marketing by companies in the agri-food sector. The results indicate that companies prioritized strategies linked to the certification of their production systems and their quality, as well as logistical capacity, environmental certifications, and commitment to climate change and fairtrade principles. Among the aspects they attach less importance, the ones related to distribution systems stand out. These results serve as a basis to support the managers of agri-food exporting companies in developing more sustainable agri-food systems through the appropriate and comprehensive use of sustainability marketing. A recommendation further arises for companies to align their sustainability marketing strategies with their market positioning, in order to support both their reputation and their competitive advantages. © 2024 The Authors","Agri-food business to business; Agri-food exports; Corporate Reputation; Sustainability marketing; Sustainable agri-food systems; Trade shows","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187222353"

Study 1 (N = 300) confirms that brand prominent meme marketing generates more favourable consumer outcomes (attitude towards ad, customer engagement) and narrative transportation compared to brand subtle meme marketing. Additionally, Study 1 examines the moderating effects of consumer brand knowledge and the mediating role of narrative transportation. Study 2 (N = 300) validates the findings of Study 1 and assesses the mediating role of narrative transportation between brand prominent meme marketing (vs. brand subtle) and outcomes among consumers with varying meme literacy. Brand prominent meme marketing yields profound consumer outcomes and narrative transportation, especially with low brand knowledge. Study 3 (N = 253) confirms the results of Studies 1 and 2 and further introduces a novel linguistic moderator, examining the use of first-person and second-person pronouns within the meme marketing content using a different product category.

Impulsive purchases by consumers make up a significant portion of the overall consumer market and are a key source of income for retailers. In response to particular consumer actions, genders exhibit various attitudes and behaviors, which require businesses to adapt their strategies to engage the audience better. This study aims (1) to have a holistic understanding of the determinants of perceived hedonic value resulting in impulsive buying behavior in the livestream e-commerce context, and (2) to determine whether gender moderates the relationship between hedonic value, impulsive buying behavior, and user stickiness. An online survey was conducted to collect data using a structured questionnaire. The survey resulted in 335 valid responses from active livestream e-commerce users. The data were analyzed to test hypotheses using SMART-PLS software. The findings indicate (1) all selected livestream e-commerce factors result in the generation of perceived hedonic value, (2) the perceived hedonic value consequently results in impulsive buying behavior and user stickiness, (3) gender moderates the relationship between perceived hedonic value and impulsive buying behavior but not user stickiness, and (4) female consumers are more susceptible to the perceived hedonic value resulting in impulsive buying behavior. The study advances past efforts in investigating antecedents of impulsive buying behavior in livestream commerce.

The results unveiled six configurations of arrangements, each characterised by a unique combination of causation. This study contributes value to virtual influencers and endorsement literature by developing an innovative research method for uncovering the intricacies associated with the switching intention. Furthermore, it provides practical recommendations for social media practitioners on how to optimise the balance between AI technology-like, human-like and social attributes based on consumer personalities, thus enhancing the successful implementation of virtual influencers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Complexity theory; fsQCA-NCA; Human-like attributes; Virtual influencers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182569320"

The topic has received much debate. The authors argue that luxury brand personality (modern vs. traditional), which encompasses a more stable form of brand identity in global markets, affects evaluations of digital interactions. They further investigate the role of self-brand connection in this process. Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments on Prolific use a European sample and manipulate a single factor between subjects (modernity: less vs. more; traditionality: less vs. more) of French luxury brands and measure evaluations as the dependent variable. Two studies assesses self-brand connection (continuous) as a moderator (studies 2a, 2b). Study 2b rules out some alternative explanations, with culture (independent vs. collectivist) as an independent variable. A fourth study, using a North American sample on CloudResearch, assesses the effect of personality manipulation (more modernity vs. more traditionality) on consumer evaluations of an Italian brand, and assesses ubiquity perceptions as a mediator. Findings: Consumers evaluate digital interactions of international luxury brands less favorably when luxury brand personality exhibits more (vs. less) modernity or less (vs. more) traditionality. Perceptions of ubiquity mediate these relationships. When self-brand connection is high, this effect is attenuated. Originality/value: The research sheds light on the debate on whether luxury brands should create digital interactions in international markets, given that these global brands operate in multiple channels. Findings show that luxury brands can develop strategies based on aspects of their brand identity, a less malleable feature of brand identity within global markets. Additionally, the research contributes to the conversation about a global luxury market. In short, the findings offer evidence in favor of brand identity (personality) influencing the digital channel strategy a brand should undertake in international markets, first, followed by consumer needs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand personality; E-commerce; International luxury strategy; Modernity; Self-brand connection; Social media","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178424652"

Based on the TVP-SV-VAR model, this paper attempts to evaluate the ability of FT and AL on mitigating climate change and lowering carbon footprints. The outcomes confirm that AL and FT play an essential role in inhibiting short- and long-term CE, respectively. Specifically, the widespread use of AL in zero-carbon buildings, automotive lightweight and renewable energy technologies highlight its effectiveness in decreasing energy consumption and enhancing environmental quality. Besides, the development of FT reduces unnecessary resource consumption and CE by simplifying payment methods and improving financial service efficiency. Moreover, the indirect effects of FT on CE are examined by considering the role of renewable energy (RE). The results show that FT has both positive and negative effects on CE. The positive impact means that FT can stimulate investors to increase investment in the RE industry and reduce carbon pollution. Against the background of promoting the goal of carbon neutrality, this paper can provide useful insights for policymakers to formulate effective carbon reduction policies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminum; Carbon emission; Fintech; Renewable energy; Time-varying","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189096156"

Growing competition, sharing economy, digital transformation, corporate environmental responsibility, and increasing customer requirements exert pressure on enterprises to change their business mentality. One can easily observe the need for integrated, environment-friendly solutions that generate new value added to customers. To achieve that, we need new business models that would allow to discover new potential in new markets. In the face of dynamic market changes, traditional business models are increasingly less capable of addressing the growing competition, sharing economy, digital transformation, corporate environmental responsibility, and the rising demands of customers. There is a clear need for integrated, environmentally friendly solutions that generate new added value for customers. Achieving this goal requires the development of new business models that enable the discovery of potential in new markets. Therefore, searching for and creating new business models that would stand up to requirements is vital. These problems could be solved by a PSS considered a personalized business model operating in an extended time horizon. PSS is an opportunity to sell product functions and availability, as well as a perspective for multiple uses of products. This paper presents a pioneering attempt to develop a Product-Service System (PSS) business model specifically tailored for the plastics industry. An innovative approach consists in the integration of a machinery and a tool into a production unit and adding an array of services to it. This groundbreaking research, unprecedented in its scale, involved a comprehensive questionnaire-based study conducted across 60 plastics processing plants employing prevalent production techniques. The study is unique in its extensive scope and depth, as such an analysis of PSS business models within the plastics industry has not been previously explored in the open literature. The research methodology applied is thorough, covering a wide range of practical aspects crucial for the effective implementation of PSS in the plastics sector. This paper stands out for its detailed examination of 60 enterprises in the plastics industry, focusing on their interest in 95 services essential for the optimal operation of plastics processing plants and their engagement with representatives from the plastics industry. This extensive study offers valuable insights into the usage of machines and tools in plastics processing, as well as the specific needs, requirements, and challenges faced by businesses in this sector. Results of analyses demonstrate that interest in services differs depending on the size of an enterprise, processing technique, having a toolroom or not, product range, and the duration of breakdowns. A new PSS business model for plastics processing was built based on the analysis of PSS design methods and sectors to which they are addressed, PSS used in practice, plastics processing sector, questionnaire-based studies conducted among plastics processing plants, statistical analyses, advice and consultancy sessions with experts from the investigated industry, finances and trade patterns for machines. Until to date the question of precise design of such a business model for the plastics processing sector has neither been examined nor discussed or evidenced. The paper aims to bridge this gap. The approach to the issue was innovative, based on a questionnaire survey and consultations with experts which allowed to faithfully reproduce the current condition of the investigated sector. In addition, each service added on to the production unit underwent a detailed statistical analysis. The hereto presented business model is extremely comprehensive as it can be used in plastics processing plants of different sizes. © 2024 The Authors","Business model; Plastics industry; Plastics processing machines; Plastics processing plants; Plastics processing tools; Product-service system (PSS)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189551154"

Leveraging digitalization, in the wake of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, holds immense potential in revolutionizing the buildings and construction sector. Digitalization is transforming buildings throughout their life cycle encompassing design, construction, operation, and retrofitting/decommissioning stages. This study aims to analyze the role of digital technologies in sustainable buildings. In doing so, a systematic literature review is conducted to examine the current landscape of the application of 13 key digital technologies - sensors, Building information modeling (BIM), Building Management Systems (BMS), smart meters, 3D printing/additive manufacturing, robotics, big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, and cyber security - in terms of their scope and prospects in the building sector. These technologies have been discussed considering their functions, applications in buildings, adoption and market trends, challenges, and the way forward. The findings of the study reveal that digital technologies are making buildings more integrated, flexible, energy-efficient, smart, and sustainable by optimizing resource utilization, enhancing operational efficiency, and minimizing environmental impact. For instance, sensors enable real-time data collection, BIM facilitates sustainability assessments, and AI enhances energy management. Further, digital technologies can lead to a 30%–50% improvement in energy intensity in the building sector by 2040. While digital technologies offer promising solutions in terms of improving sustainability standards in buildings, they also face several challenges such as high initial cost, privacy and security risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks, and lack of customer awareness and a skilled workforce. Conducive policies and regulations are critical for creating an enabling environment that supports the adoption of digital technologies. © 2024","AI; BIM; Buildings; Climate change; Digitalization; Energy efficiency; Renewable energy; Smart meters; Sustainability","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188927426"

(2009). Findings: The systematic literature review of published studies found the fragmentation, descriptive and prescriptive orientation of studies on Africa women entrepreneurship and devoid of theoretical focus. Further, women entrepreneurship studies tended to be underpinned from various disciplines, less from the entrepreneurship lens, mostly quantitative, and at its infancy stage of development. With a primary focus on development, enterprise performance and livelihood, studies rarely attended to issues of motherhood and the nuanced understanding of women entrepreneurship’s embeddedness in family and institutional contexts of Africa. Research limitations/implications: The paper questions the view that women entrepreneurship is a “panacea” and unravels how family context, customary practices, poverty and, rural-urban and formal/informal divide, significantly shape and interact with African women entrepreneurs’ enterprising experience and firm performance.

Many studies argue that the abundance of digital resources may lead to a phenomenon known as the “resource curse (RC),"" where organizations struggle to effectively leverage these resources to achieve their strategic goals, particularly in the crucial realm of low-carbon transformation and progress. This inquiry delves into the empirical examination of DE's influence and the underlying mechanisms on enterprises' low-carbon transformational evolution (LCTE), drawing upon a dataset of A-share companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2011 to 2020. The study yields several insights: firstly, DE facilitates LCTE, with a pronounced enhancement effect in eastern locales, non-resource-intensive municipalities, and metropolitan hubs; secondly, RC is found to exert a negative moderating influence on the stimulative impact DE has on LCTE; thirdly, DE augments LCTE through an escalation of corporate green technological innovation (GTI) while RC dampens DE's positive influence on GTI. While DE substantially contributes to the progress in LCTE, it presents various potential perils and challenges. It is incumbent upon business enterprises to strategically leverage DE advantages, circumvent its prospective pitfalls, and accomplish the objective of low-carbon transition, a task that demands immediate scholarly attention and investigation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Digital economic governance; Green technological innovation; Listed companies; Low-carbon transformational evolution; Resource curse","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189041732"

Natural resource-rich nations can benefit or face the resource curse. Henceforth, this study examines the economic growth of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), considering digital finance, financial regulations, and oil price shocks. Understanding the intricate relationship between oil price fluctuations and digital finance within diverse financial regulatory frameworks is essential for a comprehensive grasp of the resource curse in OPEC. The research employed a bias-corrected dynamic panel and MMQR model to analyze datasets from 2004 to 2022. The study reveals that Oil price shocks have led to higher economic growth when there are moderate financial constraints. However, they have a detrimental effect when the financial system is either very constrained or highly unconstrained. Digital finance has been shown to enhance Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across various levels of financial regulations. The GDP of OPEC experiences a significant adverse effect when digital finance and oil price shocks are coupled, particularly in the presence of stringent financial rules. This outcome is mainly attributed to the adverse influence of oil prices. The findings above underscore the need for moderate levels of financial regulations that support the favorable influence of oil prices and digital finance on GDP. The study additionally suggests a prospective strategy for enhancing GDP growth in OPEC nations: facilitating digital finance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Digital finance; Financial regulations; Oil price shocks; OPEC; Resource curse","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189541241"

What are the barriers that prevent the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What risk mitigation strategies can be adopted by firms to overcome these barriers? An inductive method using open-ended essays has been adopted to gather data from firms that have already implemented DT for CN. The findings revealed four distinct dimensions. Utilization of DT for CN includes enhancing business value, managing one's carbon footprint, enabling smart solutions, and enhancing efficiency. The drivers for adopting DT for CN included driving business growth, external pressures, competitive advantage, and environmental consciousness. Key barriers included financial barriers, technological barriers, human resource barriers, and external barriers. Risk mitigation strategies included pre-implementation strategies, detailed planning and evaluation, ensuring employees' buy-in and readiness, and external stakeholder engagement.

However, because of its early development stage, users tend to resist the adoption of this new technology. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of resistance on blockchain adoption intentions in the context of the foodservice industry. This study further explores if public pressures and climate change awareness could possibly weaken the negative relationships between blockchain resistance and adoption intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from managers and full-time employees in the foodservice industry, using an online research panel survey. A structural equation model was developed and tested to examine the hypothesized relationships. Additionally, a multi-group analysis was performed to test the moderating roles of public pressures and climate change awareness. Findings: The findings from this study confirmed that foodservice employees’ characteristics, including traditional barriers, and blockchain technology factors, like perceived risk, are both significant in forming resistance to blockchain. This study also demonstrated the significant roles of internal and external stakeholders in weakening the negative associations between blockchain resistance and adoption intentions. Research limitations/implications: This study recommends that foodservice companies address how to reduce their employees’ negative perceptions about changes imposed by blockchain adoption. This study also suggests the joint consideration of the pressures from internal and external stakeholders to provide continued insights into developing environmental practices for the foodservice industry. Originality/value: This study extends the theoretical underpinning of the innovation resistance theory by incorporating the stakeholder theory as a strong foundation for understanding how external pressures and internal awareness may influence foodservice employees’ responses to the implementation of blockchain technology to mitigate climate change. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption intentions; Blockchain technology; Climate change; Foodservice industry; Innovation resistance; Stakeholder theory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146594113"

To explore the impact and mechanisms of manufacturing enterprises' digital transformation on reducing their carbon emissions, this study uses data from A-share listed manufacturing enterprises on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2010 to 2019. Employing fixed-effect and mediation models, the empirical analyses yield the following results: (1) Digital transformation positively influences carbon emissions reduction in manufacturing enterprises. (2) The fulfillment of corporate social responsibility and advancement in technological innovation mediate the relationship between digital transformation and carbon emissions reduction. (3) Both internal (redundant resources) and external (government support) factors affect the impact of digital transformation on carbon emissions. Reducing redundant resources and strengthening government support amplify the positive effect of digital transformation, while redundant resources negatively regulate the initial phase of the impact path of “digital transformation - technological innovation–carbon emissions intensity”. (4) Heterogeneity results reveal that digital transformation plays a more significant role in carbon emission reduction for heavy-polluting enterprises and China's central region. Hence, proactive digital transformation promotion is essential for enterprises aiming to achieve the “dual-carbon” goal, with optimization of internal resource integration and government-appropriate support. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission reduction; Digital transformation; Internal and external resources; Social responsibility fulfillment; Technological innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188553116"

Despite the growing interest in Waqftech, Malaysian enterprises have not fully embraced this emerging technology because of uncertainty regarding the benefits it offers to contributors. The research incorporates two theoretical frameworks: the electronic data interchange (EDI) model for firms’ technology adoption, and the triple bottom line theory (TBL) for corporate social responsibility. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative method using a cross-sectional survey design with a five-point Likert scale questionnaire was used. Data was collected from 210 decision-makers representing small and medium-sized enterprises and analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings from this research suggest that Malaysian enterprises are influenced by both corporate and social predictive benefits when using blockchain crowdfunding, but not by environmental benefits. The adoption of blockchain smart contracts does not correlate with predictive environmental benefits because of misconceptions about the disruptive technology’s impact on biological and digital environmental preservation. Research limitations/implications: This research focuses on organizational behavior rather than individual users of waqf crowdfunding, and it is limited, primarily focusing within Malaysia and regions with similar waqf structures. Practical implications: The Waqftech framework allows innovative mechanisms for executing corporate waqf investment returns to the intended beneficiaries through the smart contracts’ platform. In addition, this study supports relevant corporate social responsibility and creating shared value technology adoption theories, including EDI and TBL. Aside from this, the study provides empirical implications for waqf management using fintech platforms. Originality/value: This groundbreaking study focuses on creating a Waqftech model for corporate waqf crowdfunding. The results of this study are important for the development of government policies that support the use of Waqftech in charitable fundraising.

This study empirically investigates the effectiveness of energy storage innovations towards a greener environment on a global scale. To this end, we use quarterly frequency time series data on a global scale over the period 2000 to 2020 and the estimation techniques based on the nonparametric multivariate quantile on quantile regression (MQQR), multivariate quantile regression (MQR), and Kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS). The empirical results reveal that energy storage innovation and nuclear energy are strongly related to a decline in carbon dioxide emissions (CO2e) but natural resources and oil consumption intensify the level of CO2e across quantiles. However, the effects of energy storage innovation, nuclear energy, natural resources, and oil consumption are heterogeneous leading to an asymmetric pattern across quantile distribution. The policy implication of this study is that, on a global scale, energy storage innovation and nuclear energy provide opportunities for attaining a greener environment and more environmentally sustainable future but natural resources and oil consumption impede policies toward a sustainable environment. Therefore, our study recommends, among other things, an aggressive boost of energy storage system and nuclear energy while decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Energy storage innovations; Global scale; Greener environment; Multivariate quantile on quantile regression; Nuclear energy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189473489"

This study, therefore, takes into account this research gap, and investigates the interrelationship between natural resources, human capital, and sustainable development, specifically in the context of China. By conducting an advanced econometric analysis, we have examined the influence of oil rents, forest rents, and mineral rents on China's economic growth from the years spanning from 1992 to 2022, while considering the control variables such as foreign direct investment (FDI) and research and development (R&D) expenditures. Our findings have revealed an asymmetric impact of mineral rents and oil rents on economic growth, while forest rents have shown a positive and considerable influence as well. This essentially indicates the presence of beneficial effects from forest resources. Moreover, we have also observed a positive association between human capital and economic expansion. in addition to this, expenditures such as those pertaining to FDI and R&D are shown to stimulate economic growth in China. Furthermore, this study also finds bi-directional causality between oil rents, FDI, and human capital, while forest rents, mineral rents, and R&D expenditures show an uni-directional causal relationship with economic growth in China. Our study contributes towards the understanding of the complex dynamics that exist between natural resources, human capital, and sustainable development in China.

The research addresses three pivotal questions: (1) Does digitalization authentically ensure sustainability in agriculture? (2) What are the paramount sustainability requirements for digitalization in agriculture? (3) Can SA systems be viably designed to concurrently fulfill digital and sustainable requisites? Employing a two-stage Quality Function Deployment (QFD) framework with the interval-valued 2-Tuple linguistic (IV-2-TL) model, the methodology offers a nuanced analysis of relationships between sustainability-digitalization and SA. Validation through a Turkey-based case study demonstrates the methodology's effectiveness in identifying digital solutions for sustainability needs and prioritizing SA design requirements. This study contributes significantly in three key ways. Firstly, the IV-2-TL-QFD method provides a valuable decision-making framework to assess digitalization-sustainability-SA interconnections ensuring optimal SA design. Secondly, it identifies vital digitalization requirements for addressing sustainability challenges in the QFD framework. Third, a 10-step roadmap guides the transition to SA, portraying digitalization as instrumental in achieving broader sustainability.

Success in these efforts depends on robust policy frameworks, effective stakeholder participation, and the availability of agricultural products to customers. This study introduces a conceptual and operational structure for the incorporation and management of an agricultural supply chain with a low-carbon scheme through the establishment of a collaborative market environment involving farmers, agricultural enterprises, and consumers. Within this framework, agricultural enterprises and farmers engage in a cooperative Nash game to determine the extent to which they are willing to employ low-carbon practices in response to collaborative market prices and government policies, including subsidies and carbon taxes. The Nash game yields a unique Nash equilibrium, suggesting the possibility of cooperative negotiations among the parties with the goal of improving their financial gains. The proposed model is applied in two Brazilian sugarcane supply chain case studies, integrating with traditional biorefinery mills to produce and market ethanol as a gasoline alternative. Our results suggest that (1) successfully allocating government subsidies and taxes motivates low-carbon adoption; (2) the government taxation policy stabilizes the low-carbon supply chain, improving stakeholder market pricing and consumer affordability; and (3) reduced cost gaps between low-carbon and non-low-carbon alternatives increase low-carbon adoption. As a result, this study provides fresh insights on the Nash collaboration of stakeholders in accordance with government policies to create a cleaner and more affordable agricultural supply chain market. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Game theory; Low-carbon; Meta-heuristics; Nash equilibrium; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188553010"

This study, thus, aims to assess the digitalisation level of the Tanzanian apparel industry through the Industry 4.0 perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods-based approach was deployed. This study deployed semi-structured interviews, document review and observation methods for the qualitative approach. For the quantitative approach, closed-ended questionnaires were used to ascertain the digitalisation levels and maturity level of the textiles and apparel (T&A) factories and small and medium-sized textile enterprises in Tanzania. The sample size was 110, with participants engaged through the purposive sampling technique. Findings: Industry 4.0 frameworks evolved into practices mainly since 2011 in several service and manufacturing industries globally. For Tanzania, the findings indicate that the overall maturity level of the T&A industries is 2.5 out of 5.0, demonstrating a medium level of adoption. Thus, the apparel industries are not operating under the industry 4.0 framework; they are operating within the third industrial revolution – Industry 3.0 – framework. For such industries to operate within the fourth industrial revolution – Industry 4.0 – that is only possible if there is significantly well-developed industrial infrastructure, availability of engineering talent, stable commercial partnerships, demand from the marketplace and transactional relationship with customers. Research limitations/implications: This study’s limitations include: firstly, Industry 4.0 is an emerging area; this resulted in limited theoretical underpinnings in the Tanzanian perspectives. Secondly, the studied industries may not suffice the need to generalise the findings for the entire country, thus needing another study. Originality/value: Although Industry 4.0 conceptual frameworks have been on trial in several industries since 2011, this is amongst the first empirical research on Industry 4.0 in the Tanzanian apparel industry that assesses the digitalisation levels. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Apparel industry; Digital transformation; Digitalisation; Digitalised technological system; Industry 4.0; Tanzania","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130580321"

In Study 2, 1502 respondents completed a questionnaire on their attitudes toward reasons for avoiding malls, and 449 were identified as mall avoiders. Structural equation modeling analysis indicated that atmospheric and social shopping irritants and a preference for online shopping increased avoidance behavior, whereas mall management's commitment to sustainability and a preference for high-street stores decreased avoidance behavior. Segmentation analysis identified three segments of mall avoiders (n = 449) and two segments of mall visitors (n = 1053) based on shopping preferences.

We initially employed structural equation modeling to develop a research framework, and then we transformed this framework into a network data envelopment analysis model. Our findings revealed that the e-SQ of LSCs has a significant positive impact on the e-satisfaction (e-SA) and e-LY of their customers. Additionally, we observed that trust plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between e-SA and e-LY. Through benchmark analysis, we found that for small-scale shippers, virtually no slack exists between their benchmark and actual perception. However, the slack increased as the scale of the shipper increased, implying that LSCs have provided an e-SQ that exceeds the expectations of their large-scale customers. Meanwhile, it's crucial for LSCs to pay attention to specific aspects such as the architecture of e-commerce platforms and privacy protection because the slacks of these e-SQ items are relatively small. Furthermore, the large slacks in e-LY for large-scale shippers imply that their e-LY leaves much room for improvement compared with that of small-scale shippers. Overall, our study underscores the importance of maintaining or elevating e-SQ standards to reinforce e-LY while considering the mediating and moderating effects of e-SA and trust in the context of the e-commerce platforms provided by major LSCs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","E-loyalty; E-service quality; Liner shipping; Network data envelopment analysis; Structural equation modeling; Trust","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188679954"

In contrast, we have demonstrated that corruption has a detrimental effect, supporting the “sand in the wheel hypothesis.” On the other side, the findings show that opening trade and capital accounts has a favorable effect on rents. Our findings thus serve as a warning about the need to enhance the quality of institutions by lowering political risk, encouraging upstanding legal principles, and combating corruption.

While introducing digital business models may bring certain advantages for insurers, there is a widespread expectation of consumers to manage their financial affairs anytime and anywhere. This article sets out by demonstrating recent phenomena on the insurance market arising from its digitalisation, i.e., automation, personalisation, insurance on-demand, machine learning & artificial intelligence, Big Data, concluding distance contracts; along with the threats to consumer safety they pose a cyber risk that may materialise at different stages of the digital insurance selling process. Further, to provide insights into how modern digital insurance markets work, the article presents the results of a study conducted by the authors on a representative sample of 2,136 respondents from Poland. The study allows one to identify certain behaviour patterns of customers in their dealings with providers of insurance products and services as well as their approach to technological innovations introduced by the traders. Crucially, the study shows that insurance consumers have a positive attitude towards the use of modern technologies in insurance, however, their knowledge on this subject is still limited. Specifically, insurance consumers tend to be more afraid of cyber risks than any legal risks resulting from deploying new technologies in the insurance sector. In conclusion, the article maps out key regulatory challenges related to ensuring consumer protection on digital insurance markets. © 2024","Consumer behaviour; Consumer protection; Cybersecurity; Financial literacy; FinTech; ICT in insurance; InsurTech; Personalization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185779181"

Despite the efforts, there has been little progress, and nearly all the countries are suffering due to climate change. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have helped little to abate the environmental issues. This is the need of the hour to address the acute environmental issues in the world, particularly in China, due to its role as the largest polluter in the world. This study used a nonlinear approach named as “Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL)” technique, to study the impact of Fintech (FNT), Natural Resources (NTR), and Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) on Environmental Sustainability (ENS) levels in China, based on the data from 2000 to 2020. FNT was found to have a positive impact on achieving ENS, while the use and extraction of NTR and TPU are detrimental to ENS in China. Furthermore, FNT can be one of the ways China would be able to achieve its SDG in the long run. China is recommended to introduce a carbon tax for polluting firms and offer tax credits for sustainable firms. This must be followed up with the provision of green credit through FNT to provide the firms with the funding needed to move towards a green economy smoothly. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental sustainability; Fintech; NARDL; Natural resources; Trade policy uncertainty","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187780113"

Secondly, mechanism analysis results confirm that industrial structure upgrading is the main channel through which the positive mediating effect operates. Thirdly, the influence of the digital economy is only valid for rural areas rather than urban areas, and more significant for western regions than eastern and central regions, which indicates the development of the digital economy is beneficial to narrowing the consumption gap. Finally, the positive impact of the digital economy on residents' consumption is continuously strengthened with the upgrading of industrial structure, which is a significant non-linear characteristic of the marginal effect increasing.

The study hypothesises that these factors encompass intrinsic potential to predict CO2 emissions. Particularly, OECD countries have been selected to analyse the nexus because these elements, specifically Fintech, have been observing constant increases. Therefore, data from 1990 to 2021 has been sourced to carry out the analysis. The analysis was performed using a panel co-integration approach along with a fully modified ordinary least square and dynamic ordinary least square technique. The outcomes of the study reveal that significant association has been observed among the variables, suggesting that the hypothesised factors have a strong network. Further, the outcomes propose that CO2 emissions are reduced with increasing financial development, i.e., Fintech. This implies that economies have to contribute to their financial development to reduce emissions and ensure sustainable development. Moreover, an increase in natural resource rents increases CO2 emissions. Similar findings are obtained for GDP, where a 1% increase in GDP results in a 49% upsurge of CO2 emissions. These results infer that higher economic activities deteriorate the environment. Lastly, green technology notes optimistic results for sustainability as CO2 emissions are reduced when there is an increasing trend in higher green technologies.The findings of this study offer valuable insights for policymakers and economists in OECD countries and beyond as they navigate the complex landscape of sustainability and economic growth.

The study shows that the digital economy significantly inhibits urban carbon emissions, and the conclusion still holds after various robustness tests. The digital economy can mitigate land resource mismatch through effective mitigation, while the rational allocation and use of land resources contribute to reducing urban carbon emissions. From the heterogeneity perspective, the digital economy's inhibitory effect on urban carbon emissions is more evident in places outside the Yangtze River Economic Belt and non-resource cities. This argues that the development of the digital economy should be fully promoted, and the allocation of land resources should be optimized to release the digital economy's environmental dividend.

This paper explores the impact of digital and carbon reduction technologies on supply chain decisions, incorporating fuzzy logic and blockchain technology for enhanced decision-making. We specifically focus on a single buyer ordering from a vendor, where faulty items are promptly returned upon inspection. The lead time for the initial delivery includes both production and non-productive time, while successive deliveries only entail transportation time. The research employs intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers to represent all carbon factors and integrates blockchain technology to improve demand forecasting. The purpose is to determine the optimal strategies to minimize the carbon and joint total cost of the system. A solution methodology has been proposed for determining optimal strategies, illustrated through a numerical example. The optimal decisions are compared, both with and without blockchain, to validate the proposed model. The findings suggest that blockchain has a substantial impact on both optimal decision-making and the results of carbon reduction efforts. Sensitivity analysis reveals that a blockchain-based supply chain is both time- and cost-efficient, reduces costs and errors in data information, and efficiently shortens lead time in the network. © 2024 The Author(s)","Blockchain technology; Data uncertainty; Supply chain; Triangular fuzzy number","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187343818"

For instance, this study considers income, population aging, industrial development, and natural resource consumption (NRS) as critical challenges for sustainability. However, digitalization (ICT), environmental policy, and natural resources protection (NRP) are considered the best alternatives to support the sustainability theme. However, this study utilizes the advanced series of estimators, i.e., the AMG, CCE-MG and CS-ARDL, to investigate the study objectives for most industrialized economies from 2000 to 2022. Investigated results show the positive contribution to environmental stress by income, population aging, NRs and industrial development. In contrast, digitalization and environmental policy significantly reduce environmental stress. In addition, this study performs aggregated & disaggregated analysis for different NRs measures, and the mineral resources only show a significant role in sustainability. Besides, under the comparative analysis between NRs consumption & protection for a sustainable environment and outcomes shows that NRs protection is the best strategy for dealing with environmental issues. Along with the main effect, this study explores the mediating effect of digitalization on environmental policy, industrial development, natural resource consumption & protection and finds their supportive response toward sustainability.

Even though there is a large amount of literature examining the trade - environment connection, most of the studies that have been done so have primarily examined variables like trade openness and foreign direct investment, ignoring the impact of particular trade policy tools, like tariffs. Moreover, there is a pertinent concern about aggregation bias in aggregate estimations, which could lead to inaccurate assessments of the overall connections and potentially misguide policymakers. In contrast to the prevailing trend, this study delves into the influence of trade policy, specifically tariffs, on the environmental degradation in 20 African nations. The investigation also addresses the issue of aggregation bias, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the trade policy-environment link. The panel long-run estimates, employing the PMG estimator, reveal a significantly negative influence of tariffs on ecological footprints. This suggests that, in this context, tariffs do not create market inefficiency but rather contribute to strengthening environmental quality in the African sub-region. The findings underscore the importance of considering specific trade policy instruments in environmental policymaking. Policymakers in the region are presented with an opportunity to strategically utilize tariffs as a tool to address environmental degradation issues. The study further highlights that the relationship is negative at the panel level but positive at some of the individual country-level, indicating the presence of aggregation bias in estimating the trade policy-environmental dilapidation association on a panel scale. As aggregation bias may lead to misguided environmental policies, policymakers are prevailed on to carefully consider both panel and individual country-particular level when formulating trade and environmental strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregation bias; Environmental sustainability; Sustainable development; Trade policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186552320"

Resource rich countries are facing this challenge to balance the growing economy natural resource needs against the richness of natural habitat. So, the study objective is to validate the non-linear impact of total natural resource extraction on biodiversity. For this purpose, 19 resource-rich countries have been considered from 2000 to 2021. A Common Correlated Mean Group (CCMG) specification is adopted in quantile regression to address cross-sectional dependence and non-normality of data. This model is specifically utilized to control for the spillover effects of natural resource markets across resource rich countries. According to the estimated results, an inverted U-shaped relationship is validated between natural resource extraction and biodiversity. Interestingly, the incorporation of financial technology encourages biodiversity. Further, the moderating effect of fintech evolves sustainable practices in natural resource extraction and promotes biodiversity. Energy intensity and population density as controlling factors of the model are damaging and improving biodiversity, respectively. Considering the inverted U-shaped relationship, policymakers are urged to design adaptive regulations that incentivize sustainable resource extraction practices.

This paper takes the smart city pilot policy (SCPP) as a quasi-natural experiment. Based on the panel data of Chinese listed enterprises during 2007–2021, the impacts of SCPP on heterogeneous enterprise green innovation (EGI) are explored using the difference-in-differences method. The results indicate that SCPP can effectively promote EGI. Particularly, SCPP contributes more significantly to energy conservation innovation at source and technology-based green innovation than end-of-pipe governance innovation and administration-based green innovation. Mechanism tests reveal that SCPP can promote EGI by increasing enterprise digitalization. SCPP is also subject to government environmental monitoring and public environmental supervision, thus encouraging EGI. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that SCPP exhibits more prominent promotion effects on EGI in eastern and central regions, non-resource-based regions, and large enterprises. Furthermore, SCPP promotes EGI while leading to long-term improvements in enterprise economic performance. This study can provide not only micro-evidence from Chinese listed enterprises for understanding the heterogeneous green innovation impact of smart city construction. The findings can also provide valuable references for other developing countries experiencing rapid urbanization and industrialization in their pursuit of green development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Enterprise digitalization; Enterprise green innovation; Government environmental monitoring; Public environmental supervision; Smart city pilot policy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187496616"

These two groups, while standing to gain increased productivity through the adoption of AIWS, also express concerns regarding the widespread implementation of this technology. Notably, artificial intelligence (AI) writing tech’s impact on content creation has been profound, with its swift grammatically accurate content generation. This adoption, however, remains controversial. The study employs a quantitative approach, combining technology acceptance model and new computer game attitude scale. This approach allows us to discern implications of using AI-powered writing tools while accounting for possible differences in different domains of use. Through a survey of 219 participants, spanning academia and business, the study explores attitudes and willingness to use AIWS. Findings yield insights into non-academic writers’ readiness and implications of AIWS adoption. Business, non-academic professionals view AIWS as a tool for efficiency and content quality, while writers in academic contexts express concerns about biases, manipulation, and job displacement. The study contributes to AIWS understanding, benefiting developers, educational institutions, and content creators, and elucidates differing attitudes and age dynamics between academics and professionals.

To this end, the STIRPAT approach, the mediation effect technique and the panel threshold technique are developed using the panel data in 69 countries from 1993 to 2019. The results show that: (i) AI promote energy transition and carbon emission reduction, and trade openness (indicated by imports, exports and total trade volume) has the mediating effect. (ii) There is a single-threshold of trade openness in the impact of AI on carbon emissions. When trade openness is below the threshold, AI has an insignificant impact on carbon emissions; when trade openness crosses the threshold, AI has a significant negative impact on carbon emissions. There is a double-threshold of trade openness in the impact of AI on energy transition. When trade openness is lower than the first threshold, the impact of AI on energy transition is not significant; When trade openness is higher than the second threshold, the positive impact of AI on energy transition is increased. (iii) When considering the heterogeneity of income levels and AI levels, the trade threshold for achieving carbon emission reductions in the high-income group is lower than that of the global group, and the trade threshold for achieving carbon emission reductions in the low-AI level group is higher than that of the global group. While this study unequivocally delineates the affirmative role of artificial intelligence in carbon emission reduction and energy transformation, particularly in the context of trade openness, we concurrently acknowledge that this viewpoint is not devoid of contention. Amidst the rapid advancement of technology and the landscape of open trade, we discern the presence of counterarguments. The efficacy of artificial intelligence is susceptible to the influence of multifaceted factors. It is imperative to consider associated factors, such as the significant energy consumption required for storing and cooling data centers and servers.

This has given rise to a specific form of innovation strategy, “data-push innovation”, which consists of stimulating the use of existing data by third-party actors. However, how to manage such a strategy remains challenging. The paper explores this question by examining the longitudinal case study of an actor that has successfully stimulated the use of Earth observation data by multiple actors over the last 40 years. The paper offers several contributions to research in information systems and innovation management. First, the paper shows that data-push innovation can be fostered through the intentional design of a so-called “fit system” allowing data to be used in multiple contexts. Such a fit system can be built as a generic system, following similar “generification” strategies as those supporting platform or software development but with original patterns to adapt to the specificities of data-push innovation. Second, the paper characterizes the types of “boundary resources” needed to support this process. These boundary resources especially have a two-way resourcing function: they help third-party actors contribute to the fit system development, but they also allow the fit system owner to identify the knowledge boundaries preventing data from gaining meaning in new contexts. Third, the paper reveals an intriguing form of localized and nondominant platform leadership, focusing on gaining generative power rather than controlling power over the platform ecosystem. © 2024 The Authors","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187202477"

However, as the sharing economy expanded, questions about its sustainability emerged. This expansion manifested in two main forms: an influx of new users and providers into existing operations and the emergence of new platforms, resulting in a proliferation of sharing economy models. By categorizing these models based on their resource utilization, this paper establishes a connection between scalability and compromised sustainability, shedding light on the interplay between the two. The paper identifies seven distinct configurations in the sharing economy: co-use, re-use, repeated use, sustainable output, pooling of resources, and products and services created specifically for individual users. These configurations serve as a tool to uncover the tensions between scalability and coordination, as well as between sustainability and provision. The paper contributes to prior research by bringing attention to how the sharing economy is entangled in these tensions and by developing a typology. Understanding how these tensions can be resolved presents a highly significant practical contribution, allowing stakeholders in the sharing economy to navigate the challenges of scalability and sustainability effectively. © 2024 The Author","Base of the pyramid; Configuration; Resource use; Scaling of operations; Sharing economy; Sustainability; Typology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186960991"

Based on the Instrumental Variables Two-Stage Least Squares (IV-2SLS) technique, we obtain the following results: Firstly, financial openness is a powerful driver of economic transformation in SSA; secondly, our results remain stable following several sensitivity tests related to economic digitization, financial development, types of natural resources, quality of institutions, historical, cultural, and geographic factors; and finally, our results are robust to the use of alternative measures of financial openness and economic transformation, but also to changes in instrumentation and estimation technique. Consistent with our result, we suggest that policymakers should boost the attractiveness for foreign direct and portfolio investments while maintaining fundamental balances. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Economic complexity; Economic transformation; F02; Financial openness; G10; KAOPEN index; O14; SSA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187119345"

By analyzing manually collected data on municipal government official turnovers in China spanning from 2007 to 2020, we discover a notable increase in corporate green investments following these turnovers, aligning with resource dependency theory. The upswing in green investment results from both corporate initiatives and government influence. Companies that intensify green investments after political turnovers enjoy benefits such as reduced taxes and increased subsidies. The impact of political turnovers on green investments becomes more pronounced amid economic and political uncertainties, particularly under externally appointed officials. This effect is most significant in the energy sector and non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). Despite the observed surge in green investment activity post-turnovers, there is a tendency for these initiatives to subsequently decrease overall firm performance, likely due to the higher costs associated with green investments. This study contributes to our understanding of how political turnovers shape enterprises' sustainability practices and offers valuable insights for businesses navigating the implications of environmentally responsible development. © 2023","Change of politicians; China; Corporate green investment; Political turnovers; Sustainable engagement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188511216"

The research uses the TVP-SV-VAR methodology to recognise the ever-changing correlation among the artificial intelligence index (AII), global supply chain pressure indicator (GSCPI) and global energy-related uncertainty index (GEUI). In light of quantitative discussions, it is presented that AII exerts negative influences on GSCPI and GEUI, highlighting that the development of artificial intelligence would facilitate global supply chain stability and energy sustainability; in turn, GSCPI and GEUI have positive and adverse influences on AII. Through comparing, the correlation between AII and GEUI is only reflected in the short term, whereas the interrelationship between AII and GSCPI could be observed in the short-, medium- and long-run situations. In addition, GSCPI exerts positive and negative influences on GEUI in the short, medium and long runs, whereas the positive effects of GEUI on GSCPI means the uncertainty in the energy market might destroy the supply chain across the globe. In the context of a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, this study will provide significant recommendations to maintain global supply chain stability and energy sustainability by applying artificial intelligence technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Energy sustainability; Global supply chain; TVP-SV-VAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188531462"

Though stringent policies may have the potential to decrease revenues from activities such as mining or logging, they interact intricately with the income generated from these resources. This interaction is notably influenced by the nation's level of financial development (FD).The impact of FD on the interplay between environmental regulations and natural resource rents demands careful examination. It provides businesses with the financial means and tools necessary for adopting sustainable practices and enhancing their profitability. To delve into this relationship, we investigated the role of financial growth in mediating the connection between the Environmental Policy Stringency Index (EPSI) and three types of natural resource rents (NRRs) in G11 countries from 1995 to 2022. Utilizing FD as a mediator, we employed a structural equation model to estimate EPSI's direct, indirect, and overall impact on NRR. Our study revealed a direct link between EPSI and a decrease in NRRs. However, FD significantly mitigates this relationship, lessening the negative impact of EPSI on NRRs. It suggests that NRRs directly decline with tightened environmental regulations. Yet, a well-developed financial sector acts as a protective buffer, diminishing the detrimental effects of environmental policies on NRRs. This underscores the critical role of FD in sustaining responsible resource management, emphasizing the need for legislators to consider financial institutions' support for environmental objectives. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental policy stringency; Financial development; G11; Gas rents; Mineral rents; Oil rent","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187668934"

However, the role of advanced financial technologies (FinTech) in achieving SD has received less attention. This recent study builds upon previous literature by examining the impact of financial technologies alongside natural resources and green technologies on three Sustainable Development indicators across different time frames. The study employs daily data and uses advanced econometric tools such as heatmap-based QVAR, CAViaR-QVAR, and quantile coherence methods. The findings demonstrate significant connectedness among the selected markets over various time horizons, as the QVAR method indicates. Moreover, the CAViaR-QVAR approach reveals directional interconnectedness both within and between these series, suggesting they function as both influencers and recipients of impact. This is particularly evident during major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Further, the study investigates the marginal effects of financial technologies, natural resources, and green technologies on SD. In the short and medium term, the effects of these variables are mixed, indicating a complex relationship. However, in the long term, these mixed effects tend to align positively across different frequency domains, highlighting the beneficial influence of these factors on SD. The study underscores the nonlinear nature of the series, reinforcing the necessity of advanced econometric tools for robust and comprehensive analysis.

Based on the SECI model, this study analyzes the effects of digital transformation on four knowledge creation processes, using panel data from Chinese listed manufacturing enterprises from 2007 to 2020. The study provides several novel findings. First, digital transformation positively affects all knowledge creation processes, with the effects on knowledge combination capability being particularly notable. Second, the effects of digitalization inputs on externalization and combination are insignificant but exert a negative impact on socialization and internalization. Third, a heterogeneity analysis reveals that the facilitating effect of digital transformation is more significant in state-owned and large enterprises. Moreover, it primarily acts as the ""cherry on top,"" significantly benefiting enterprises that already have strong knowledge creation capabilities.

The results showed that the CIP significantly reduced household carbon emissions through the green consumption awareness enhancing effect and green supply capacity improving effect. Heterogeneity tests indicated that carbon reduction effects are stronger in electricity and gas consumption and relatively modest in the heating and transportation domains. Cities with higher financial technology levels and greater government intervention had better policy outcomes.

Much of the discourse revolved around selecting appropriate mining methodologies like striking a balance between ore and waste selectivity, optimization of implementation scales, reducing costs, and adaptation of suitable metallurgical extraction methods. However, the concept of the fourth industrial revolution emerged as a critical factor in determining sustainability, success, and competitiveness within the contemporary mining sector. Therefore, this research aims to provide an overview of the digital transformation within the minerals and extractive industry, specifically focusing on energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. The current research explored geological factors that impact mining selectivity and technologies designed for waste rejection. Environmentally friendly approaches, such as using tunnel-boring machinery or non-explosive techniques, aid in ore fragmentation explored in this research that help reduce energy consumption during mineral processing and enhance mineral recovery. Additionally, this research deeps dive into the adoption of low-water-consumption automated ore-waste sorting systems. In this regard, selective mining leaching through the percolation of coarse particles offers an alternative approach for processing complex low-grade ores. Moreover, the assessment of new technological frontiers in the mineral sector has been done in the current research. The amalgamation of these processes promises a substantial reduction in mining waste. Furthermore, this research concludes that various factors such as orebody characteristics, the selection of mining techniques and equipment, the intended implementation scales, adherence to circular strategies, ore extraction efficiency, and socio-economic considerations influence the development and implementation of novel technologies and methods in the mining industry. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Digital transformation; Environmentally friendly approaches; Industrial revolution; Mining industry; Selective mining percolation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186370460"

Foundational examples include the British transition from sailing ships to steamships and the American transition from traditional factories to mass production. Herein lies a paradox, transitions concern large scale system change for example transition to electric cars or renewable energy, but large-scale options for technological change driven by incumbents have received less attention in transitions research. This is an important opportunity for transition research to draw on the literature of project management research on large-scale projects. We bridge transitions research and project management research by exploring speciation and aggregation from both perspectives. We illustrate how this bridge may be instantiated drawing on published research and interviews on six megaprojects that have been instrumental in the digital transformation of UK construction: (i) the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, (ii) Heathrow Terminal 5, (iii) London Olympics, (iv) Crossrail, (v) Thames Tideway and (vi) High Speed Two. The speciation of digital technology seeds the process of aggregation and UK industry transition which is driven by incumbents at the organizational field core and ripples outward to its periphery. This is a reverse process to the one mostly considered in transition research where change initiates in small niches peripheral to an organizational field and propagates until it eventually brings about large-scale change to its core. © 2024 The Author(s)","Aggregation; BIM; Project management; Speciation; Transitions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185538372"

Examining how the digital economy supports societal development, technological advancement, and environmental improvement is worthwhile. This study examines the correlation between the growth of the digital economy, the modernization of the economic framework, and green total factor productivity (GTFP) using data from 276 Chinese cities from 2012 to 2018. To achieve this, the study utilizes Tobit regression and quantile regression models. Efficiency index approaches are used in the empirical examination for calculating green total factor productivity (GTFP). Although there are apparent regional variances, China's GDP might grow significantly due to the digital economy. The gross domestic product of the city's digital industry is larger than the higher GTFP, which accounts for its growth. On a more comprehensive and dynamic level, the electronic economy has favorably impacted China's GDP share percentage. A medium-range distribution system for the digital economy that supports GTFP is modernizing industrial infrastructure.

Under the increasingly severe requirement of sustainable development, there is still a lack of research on the economic effect of political acuity from the perspective of enterprise's positive party value creation. We built a dictionary of political acuity and demonstrated reliability through machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Then, based on the annual reports of China's listed companies from 2013 to 2020, the relationship between political acuity, ESG atmosphere, and corporate performance is empirically discussed. Research findings: Examination through the formal institutional perspective of informal institutionalization shows that the positive acuity of the Communist Party of China(CPC) and the democratic parties(DPC) will improve corporate performance, while the negative acuity will have an early warning effect on performance. Furthermore, the stronger ESG atmosphere synergized this relationship. The CPC's negative acuity has supervision effect on non-state-owned companies, and this supervisory effect still exists in the ESG atmosphere. However, whether the moderating effect is considered or not, the positive political acuity of state-owned enterprises doesn't significantly improve performance. We found that the CPC's embedding in corporate governance will lead to both economic and political benefits, and have thresholds. Academic implications: We constructed a political acuity dictionary and introduced text analysis and nonparametric estimation method in this paper, which provided a basis and reference for future research on political acuity at the enterprise level. Our findings also enrich the institutional theory and the embeddedness theory. Policy implications: Meanwhile, our research broadened the boundary of political parties, ESG, and enterprises, the integration of ideological values and formal institutions, and had practical implications for the green transformation of firms and the precise positioning of political party functions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Annual report information disclosure mining; Dictionary of political acuity; Enterprise performance; ESG atmosphere; Machine learning algorithm; Political acuity","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186494432"

According to the empirical results, low urbanization is visible in the geographical distribution of innovative rural businesses, and there are also apparent positive regional spillover and radiation-driving effects. These effects are particularly noticeable in areas with comparable degrees of urbanization. Furthermore, various locations with varying patterns of grain production and family income levels are shown to have varied impacts. In the end, the study highlights the importance of closely tying farmers’ creativity and business skills together and offers empirical proof for the requirement of implementing unique and targeted incentive programs for rural entrepreneurship in the context of the shifting economic landscape. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Energy transition; Rural development; Rural economic; Sustainable agriculture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188612819"

These questions are imperative to achieve sustainable development and energy transformation. In response, this study conducts an empirical investigation into fintech's implications and regional spillovers on energy dependence from 2013 to 2021. The study unveils that fintech significantly reduces dependence on fossil fuels. Industrial structure and urbanization also positively impact reducing energy dependence. The inhibitory effect of fintech on energy dependence follows a non-linear characteristic. As the level of fintech increases, fossil fuel energy dependence tends to rise and decline afterward. Notably, these effects are heterogeneous, characterized by the higher the level of local energy dependence, the level of state intervention, and the level of financial development, the stronger the degree of its role. There are significant spatial spillovers from the suppression of energy dependence by fintech, manifesting in positive agglomeration. Therefore, fintech should be promoted to empower the financial sector through the application of digital technology to achieve resource conservation and reduce energy dependency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Energy dependence; Fintech; Fossil fuel; Spatial spillovers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187198385"

China's energy consumption is extensive due to its position as the second-largest global economy and leading importer of crude oil. A stable crude oil supply can support China's steady economic growth. The China Crude Oil Futures (INE) launch in 2018 has enriched the WTI and Brent crude oil market systems, further consolidating the critical position of crude oil in China's economic and financial development. Therefore, this paper first examines the impact of crude oil price uncertainty on the investment activities of Chinese micro-enterprises by selecting three crude oil futures: WTI, Brent, and INE. Based on the quarterly (half-year) report of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed enterprises from 2008 to 2023, this study examines the effects of uncertainty in crude oil prices on investment spending and efficiency inside enterprises and the underlying mechanisms that drive these effects. This study provides evidence that the fluctuation in crude oil prices has a detrimental impact on investment expenditure, while concurrently improving the investment efficiency of enterprises. The mechanism test also demonstrates that the volatility of crude oil prices has the potential to diminish investment expenditure and enhance the investment efficiency of enterprises. On the macro level, it mainly depends on reducing the macroeconomic boom index, enterprise boom index, and entrepreneur confidence index. At the micro level, it relies on increasing enterprise cash flow, lowering enterprise investment expectations and consumer product demand. Further heterogeneous analysis indicates that during significant events such as the global COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, there is a substantial increase in crude oil price uncertainty, leading to reduced enterprise investment expenditure and improved enterprise investment efficiency. Furthermore, the volatility associated with the increase in oil prices has a more pronounced effect on investment outlays and operational effectiveness. Moreover, the volatility of crude oil prices significantly influences the investment expenditure and investment efficiency of enterprises in the secondary industry and non-state-owned sectors. This empirical study examined the causal relationship between crude oil price, investment spending, and investment efficiency. The results of this investigation enhance the current scholarly knowledge on the relationship between crude oil prices and investment, so contributing to the advancement and refinement of this particular field of inquiry. This paper makes a valuable exploration and attempt to explain the mechanism of the impact of crude oil price on the investment activities of micro-enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Crude oil price uncertainty; Enterprise investment efficiency; Enterprise investment expenditure; INE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186952940"

Studying the impact of digital finance on the export growth of manufacturing enterprises has become an important issue in the current transformation of foreign trade for manufacturing enterprises. This article studies the internal role of digital finance in the growth of enterprise exports from a new perspective of digital finance, aiming to demonstrate the impact of digital finance on the sustainability of Chinese manufacturing enterprise exports. Based on theoretical analysis of the impact of digital finance on enterprise exports, this article uses micro-matching data from the China Industrial Enterprise Database and the Customs Database to empirically test the impact and mechanism of digital finance on enterprise export growth. Empirical research has found that digital finance significantly promotes the growth of enterprise exports, and there is a positive correlation between digital finance and enterprise export growth. This conclusion remains robust after a series of tests. The heterogeneity test shows that digital finance has a more significant role in promoting the export growth of private enterprises and enterprises in the eastern region. Mechanism research shows that digital finance mainly promotes enterprise export growth through mechanisms such as alleviating manufacturing enterprises' financing constraints and enhancing their innovation capabilities, which is consistent with the sustainable development goals. This article provides evidence to support the innovative development of the digital finance and guide the transformation of traditional financial institutions to digital financial services. It also provides useful ideas for enterprises to solve export financing problems and achieve export growth. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Digital finance; Export trade margins; Financing constraints; Sustainable export growth","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185664019"

Data-driven digital transformation supports supply chains in achieving higher carbon reduction while improving efficiency and economic performance. However, the conditions under which data-driven digital transformation can provide the desired effect remain unclear due to a lack of empirical evidence. This study aims to address this gap by examining how data-driven digital transformation, enabled by data analytics capabilities, contributes to establishing a win-win situation between carbon and economic performance in the face of several sources of carbon uncertainty through fostering supply chain carbon transparency. Drawing upon the organizational information-processing theory, we posit that the fit between information needs to reduce carbon uncertainties and the information capabilities provided by data-driven digital transformation is critical for enhancing supply chain carbon transparency and balancing supply chains' economic and carbon performance. We examine these relationships using regression tests based on survey data from 437 manufacturing companies from different regions (i.e., Europe, Africa, and Asia). Our results reveal that data analytics capabilities alone cannot enhance supply chain carbon transparency until integrated into a comprehensive business transformation. In that case, carbon transparency would positively mediate overcoming carbon uncertainties and improve the supply chains' carbon and economic performance. © 2024","carbon neutrality; carbon transparency; carbon uncertainties; Data-analytics capabilities; Data-driven digital transformation; OIPT","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185555474"

This conceptualization includes the core stakeholders, processes, outcomes, and shortcomings of reward-based crowdfunding, providing theoretical structure to this consequential articulation of platform capitalism. In addition, this conceptualization advances theory about how gift and market economies intersect. Whereas previous research emphasizes the tensions that characterize their interface, this article brings to the fore the complementary, scalable relationship between gift-giving and market exchange.  © 2023 The Author(s).

In the low-carbon industry, positioning affective features of the products effectively gives firm a competitive edge. By applying blockchain to online product communities (OPCs), firms can gain insights into consumers' affective requirements during product positioning. In this study, we develop a game-theoretic framework to explore how to optimize affective design of low-carbon products with blockchain application. We find that firms' affective product design depends on two conflicting forces. On one hand, blockchain adoption in OPCs enhances estimation precision, motivating firms to provide mass products that meet mainstream marketplace requirements. On the other hand, blockchain implementation improves estimation similarity, inducing firms to target niche markets. The network effect exacerbates these two conflicting forces, and the trade-off between them determines firms' product design decisions. Additionally, we examine the impacts of blockchain adoption on firms' profits, environmental performance, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We discover that blockchain application in OPCs is always socially beneficial. However, blockchain adoption's effect on economic and environmental performance, as well as consumer surplus, is contingent on the significance of the conflicting forces. We further conduct a survey and in-depth interviews to validate these findings. © 2024 The Authors","Affective design; Blockchain technology; Low-carbon products; Online product communities; Product positioning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188666884"

We incorporate decentralized off-chain storage to ensure the security and integrity of digital media. This leads to preserving both the digital media and associated NFT metadata in a secure manner. We leverage the intrinsic features of blockchain, such as tamper-proof logs and data provenance, to enable users to verify the authenticity of digital media. We introduce a decentralized reputation system that employs equations, trust factors, and trust badges. Through this system, digital creators are incentivized with trust badges based on their trust factor values, which enhances the overall credibility of the content.

The findings are as follows: Firstly, the YRPS helps to deleverage heavily polluting corporates, and this deleveraging effect will increase over time. Secondly, when the corporates belong to the middle and lower reaches of the YREB and the financial supervision degree of the areas are higher, the YRPS will have a stronger inhibitory impression on the leverage of heavily polluting corporates. Thirdly, when the corporates are state-owned, technology-intensive, and capital-intensive, the YRPS will have a better deleveraging effect on heavily polluting corporates. Fourthly, the YRPS mainly works on the leverage of heavily polluting corporates by reducing the financing capacity of corporates, reducing the capital investment of corporates, and weakening the operating risks of corporates.

Which tools are suitable for handling complex digital twins? Project management must respond to this with suitable approaches. The challenge for decision-makers is to choose the right one. Based on literature research and a case study, influencing factors are derived and practice-relevant project management approaches are collected. Furthermore, a decision model is developed that, on the one hand, supports the decision-maker in selecting tools before and during the project, and on the other hand makes empirical values from past projects usable for future decisions. The results show that the number of influencing factors is large, and the approaches are di-verse.

In practice it turns out that complex projects – like Digital Twins-often fail. Modified decision models for selecting suitable approaches should therefore take the following as-pects into account: (a) decision-makers are actively supported in the initial decision phase; (b) initial decisions once made are checked in the early phase of the project and corrected if necessary; (c) the lessons learned are recorded in the database as empirical value and used for future decisions. © 2024 Growing Science Ltd.

Our results show that the effects of choice and decision autonomy on AI adoption holds even when product choice evaluation is complex. We also found that identity-relevant consumption moderates this relationship, such that it interacts with choice and decision autonomy. Specifically, despite lacking choice and decision autonomy, those who identify strongly with a given activity are more likely to use an AI-enabled app to purchase the product needed to perform this activity.

In this research, the system dynamics (SD) approach was proposed to investigate digitalization as a strategic decision considering the inherent relationships between project company and business levels. The SD model was conceptualized, formulated, and tested by conducting a demonstrative case study within a modular construction company. Conforming to the strategic priorities of the case company, business process engineering principles were adopted to model the existing practices and assess the impacts of implementing digital technologies such as building information modeling (BIM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and radio frequency identification (RFID) at different maturity levels. The simulation tests revealed that the impacts of technologies are influenced by the internal dynamics of projects and company competencies as well as external uncertainties. The SD model has the potential to improve strategic decision-making by anticipating the causalities and feedback between the decisions and consequences of technology integration. The findings and model development steps proposed in this paper can be used by other companies that aim to make process improvements with digital technologies as well as researchers exploring the implications of digitalization in construction considering competencies and uncertainties. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Digitalization; Strategic decision-making; System dynamics modeling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182930412"

To do so, we conducted a multiple case study through the lens of agency theory. Three Swiss companies which are carrying out blockchain projects for their supply chain have been analyzed in semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Two significant findings of the impact on principal-agent relationships are stressed. Firstly, blockchain technologies can reduce the asymmetry of information, increase the control of agents, and consequently minimize the trust in the principal towards the agents. Secondly and paradoxically, the control mechanisms inherent in these technologies can decrease the agent's trust in the principal. Thus, questioning trust is necessary, both as an antecedent and an unexpected consequence when adopting blockchain technologies. Finally, we provide guidelines for initiating the adoption of blockchain technologies in supply chains. © 2024 The Authors","Adoption; Agency theory; Blockchain technologies; Supply chain management; Trust","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182387349"

In this study, we evaluate the two aspects together; i.e., the compound effect of adopting servitization as a business model and closing the loop in a two-tier supply chain. To this end, we focus on four scenarios as (i) selling and (ii) servitization in forward supply chains and (iii) selling and (iv) servitization in closed-loop supply chains. We evaluate the four settings in terms of economic and environmental performance. We find that both closing the loop and shifting from selling to servitization in the downstream improves the environmental performance of the supply chain. Moreover, closing the loop tends to increase the profits of the actors. However, the retailer's switch from selling to servitization significantly deteriorates the manufacturer's profit although it improves the retailer's profit. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Closed-loop supply chain; Selling; Servitization; Supply chain management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183992035"

It finds that neighborhood residents are potentially the most significant actors and hosts of smart spatial attributes. The mechanism emerges through people's diverse and technologically mediated interactions. At the neighborhood scale, the everyday urban smart neighborhood is produced via individuals' socializing and the sharing of information about events. Smart neighborhoods are facilitated and sustained by relatively practical and simple technologies, and their making is more an approach for improving the quality of urban life than a designated goal to achieve.

Therefore, this study has conducted a comprehensive literature review for six years (2017–2022) on the convergence of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Distributed Ledger (Blockchain) technologies for supporting Dataspace integration efforts at the Edge. As an outcome, this study has identified relevant challenges that include heterogeneity, integration and interoperability, distributed security, trust, scalability, and resource management. It has also been found that very limited research covers the architectural aspects of distributed edge in the context of the convergence of technologies for Dataspace integration purposes. Therefore, this study has proposed an architectural framework – Distributed Edge Network Operations-oriented Semantic (DENOS) model that extends the traditional Cloud–Edge-Device architecture with three new layers – Semantic, Convergence, and Dataspace integration. In addition, the model leverages the power of semantic modelling (i.e., Processing, Service, and Data) context, which enables the model to have a dynamic implementation context to suit the diverse needs of target use cases. To showcase the validation of the model, a use case related to the digital traceable operation of the wind energy domain has been presented. The objective of the DENOS model is to enable Dataspace integration to build edge-enabled value chain networks.

In the digital era, products emerge on a layered modular architecture, and profiting from innovation is shifting to those who own control points. Despite the centrality of the interplay between the product architecture and industry architecture for value creation and value capture in the digital age, the effects on competitiveness and industry dynamics remain unclear.

Countries strive to enhance their supply chain performance by increasing connectivity with partner countries and reducing dwell times at logistics hubs. In this study, the supply chain performance of countries based on international tracking indicators is examined using a multi-criteria decision-making approach. The paper encompasses two primary objectives. The first objective is the determination of the supply chain performance of countries. The second one is the development of a novel alternative ranking method. The study employs 10 supply chain key performance indicators as criteria and utilizes data from 72 countries. The data is sourced from logistics performance index reports published by the World Bank. The modified preference selection index (MPSI) is employed for criterion weighting. For the ranking of countries, a novel alternative ranking method named the “Alternative Ranking using two-step LOgarithmic Normalization (ARLON)” method is proposed. Through the implementation of the MPSI-ARLON hybrid method, supply chain performance and rankings of countries are computed. The findings are supported by sensitivity and comparative analyses. Furthermore, robustness tests are conducted for the ARLON method. The research concludes by presenting implications and managerial insights derived from the ARLON method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","ARLON; Connectivity; Dwell time; MCDM; MPSI; Supply chain performance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183525097"

Collaboration is interesting and important in connecting the digital context with the physical world (IoT) to feed processes with data or send data. However, it also presents multiple challenges, such as the lack of trust between participants with each other and additional privacy and security problems in the communicated data. Fraud detection is crucial for many type of organisations that deal with B2B transactions (banking, fintech, health, etc.) and are therefore exposed to a high risk of fraud. Fraud detection requires expensive professional investigations and intensive collaboration between processes of different organisations. This issue could be mitigated by effectively managing digital evidence, fostering trust and ensuring security for various stakeholders involved in the business processes. This paper proposes an approach to modelling and deploying any collaborative business process scenario, ensuring trust, security, and data privacy. Collaboration-level agreements are defined as a means to ensure trust, security, and data privacy. To accomplish this, our approach enables the automatic generation Smart Contract templates for the collaboration-level agreement specification involving different stakeholders in the collaboration. The Smart contracts are deployed in a Blockchain to ensure that the collaboration-level agreement conditions are signed by the parties. To validate the feasibility of our approach, a proof-of-concept for a fraud detection scenario is implemented, where different metrics are tested in relation to a set of threats and vulnerabilities. © 2024 The Author(s)","Blockchain; Business process; Internet of Things; Privacy; Security; Trust","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184618918"

Nevertheless, as the incidence of cyber threats continues to increase, there is a corresponding increase in users' perceptions of risk. Therefore, to address risk perceptions, it is imperative to investigate and understand the protective behavior of users in this domain. However, the significance of protective behavior concerning perceived risk in the digital banking literature has yet to be discussed. This study examines users' protective behavior and its' suppressor effect on perceived risk by examining the interplay between protective behavior, perceived risk, and actual use behavior of m-wallet/banking in rural and urban settings. The proposed framework integrates the Protection Motivation Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior with social media norms. Structural Equation Modeling was applied to analyze the data from 722 responses. According to the findings, threat and coping appraisal and subjective and social media norms are vital determinants in framing attitude towards protective behavior, further determining protective and use behavior.

Meme tourism involves new forms of visit intention, where individuals are motivated to visit a destination by viral memes, and once on location, they recreate and re-enact elements of the meme before sharing the results via social media. Such use of memes in the tourism context – often considered as a casual reflection of individuality, pop culture, and a new way of communicating in social media – raises the question of how to influence and nurture travelers' behaviors and actions during an actual trip. To empirically test the ability of memes to induce specific actions during visits, this study developed an integrated model using affordance as an overarching theoretical framework to provide insights into the actualization of two types of meme affordances – Imitation and Self-presentation – during tourism visits. With survey data collected from individual tourists using a crowdsourcing platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), this research found that the relationship between both affordances (imitation and self-presentation) and travel intention was significant. The results of the study offer alternative explanations of the possible psychological influence of memes in inducing physical behaviors, which adds insight to behavioral research fields such as IS.

However, open issues still exist when addressing cyber–physical convergence in traditional manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises. The problem for both traditional operators and the existing infrastructure is how to adapt knowledge to the increasing business needs of manufacturing plants that demand high efficiency, while reducing production costs. In this paper, a framework that implements the novel concept of Digital Twin Learning Ecosystem in traditional manufacturing is presented. The objective is to facilitate the integration of human-machine knowledge in different industrial cyber–physical contexts and eliminate existing technological and workforce barriers. This adaptive approach is particularly important in meeting the requirements to help small and medium-sized enterprises build their own interconnected Digital Twin Learning Ecosystem. The contribution of this work lies in a single digital twin learning framework for different traditional manufacturing scenarios that can work from scratch using a light infrastructure, reusing the knowledge and common condition-based methods well-known by skilled workers to rapidly and flexibly integrate existing legacy resources in a non-intrusive manner. The solution was tested using real data from a milling machine and a currently operating induction furnace with a maximum power of 12 MW in a foundry plant.

In order to address this gap; this study investigates the role of financial inclusion and technological advancement in the context of environmental pollution for the E-7 countries. In this regard, the results of the cointegration analyses show evidence of long-term relationships between TA, Financial inclusion, and environmental degradation.

To this end, we propose a novel deep learning method, a user-response-guided deep attention network (URGDAN), to predict financial distress using current reports. In the proposed method, we construct a deep learning architecture to integrate financial indicators, current report texts, and user responses. URGDAN leverages the user responses to current reports to guide the semantic feature representation of the reports, it also identifies event information that has a significant correlation with company financial distress. Empirical evaluation shows that URGDAN significantly improves predictive performance and can accurately determine the importance of different current reports.

In this paper, the theoretical mechanism through which the digital economy affects green innovation is dissected and panel data from 278 Chinese cities covering the period of 2011 to 2019 are collected to empirically test both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the impact of the digital economy on green innovation. The results show the following: (1) The digital economy exerts a dual impact by both increasing quantity and improving quality in green innovation. (2) By eliminating financial restrictions, encouraging industrial collaborative agglomeration, and raising governmental environmental concerns, the digital economy exerts an influence on green innovation. (3) The relationship between the digital economy and green innovation is significantly negatively mediated by fiscal decentralization. (4) The digital economy hinders the growth of green innovation by exerting a negative spatial spillover effect on surrounding areas. (5) The digital economy has a more positive impact on green innovation in eastern cities, large cities, cities with high administrative hierarchy, and cities with strong intellectual property rights protection. Based on the conclusions of this study, we propose that the government should continue to promote the development of the digital economy in the future to fully release the innovation dividend of the digital economy, accelerate the construction of a scientific performance appraisal system to overcome government failure in the process of green innovation, and consider the differences in the development of regions to form a new pattern of synergistic green innovation between regions. In this paper, to understand how the digital economy promotes green innovation, we not only provide theoretical and empirical evidence at the city level but also provide references and insights with which governments can improve their green innovation incentive policies and optimize the design of fiscal decentralization systems for the promotion of green innovation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","C33; Digital economy; Fiscal decentralization; Green innovation; O32; R11; Spatial spillover","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185316121"

However, there have been limited attempts to assess the consequences of implementing AI systems on the quality and efficiency of decision-making. This study proposes and empirically examines an extended model covering all aspects that would shape the successful adoption of AI by decision-makers while investigating how the successful adoption of AI enhances the efficiency of the decision-making process. This study also intends to test the validity of the integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) proposed by Cao et al. (2021) using the Middle East context (i.e. Saudi Arabia). The extended model of the current study was based on the IAAAM and IS professional distinctiveness (ISPD). Two quantitative studies were conducted to achieve the research objectives. The first study was conducted to validate the IAAAM using a purposive sample of employees (non-adopters of AI applications). The second study tested the proposed model using a purposive sample of employees (actual adopters). The structural equation modelling (SEM) results of the first study (non-adopters) supported the validity of the IAAAM in Saudi Arabia. Factors (performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FC), personal well-being concern (PWC), perceived threat (PT), and attitudes (ATT)) had a significant impact on either ATT or the intention to use AI. The SEM results of actual adopters supported the impact of PE, EE, FC, PWC, and ATT on either ATT or the adoption of AI (AoAI). As an external factor, the ISPD was the most significant predictor of AoAI. The AoAI was confirmed to strongly predict decision-making efficiency, which, in turn, contributes to functional performance. This study enriches the current understanding of the main factors that contribute to the successful implementation of AI systems, offering an in-depth understanding of both AI adopters and non-adopters. It identifies factors important to non-users to enhance future adoption, whereas current AI users focus on improving decision-making quality with the AI assistance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Adoption; AI; AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM); Decision-making efficiency; Functional performance; IS professional distinctiveness; Saudi Arabia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181156124"

In this paper, we build on previous research to focus on the technological, social, economic, cultural, and political determinants of technology adoption. Using the Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (FsQCA) with samples of 101 and 43 countries, we perform a configurational analysis to explore the interdependency among these five categories of factors and their causal effect on the adoption of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi). We obtain various causal combinations of the technological, social, economic, cultural, and political factors that are associated with a high level of cryptocurrency and DeFi adoption. In addition, our analysis highlights the key role of the social, economic, and cultural factors in influencing both crypto and DeFi adoption. Technological and political factors, nevertheless, play a less important role in driving blockchain adoption. We also find intriguing differences between cryptocurrency and DeFi adoption. Our results both support and challenge existing findings in the technology adoption literature and offer theoretical implications for future research. © 2024 The Author(s)","Configurational analysis; Cryptocurrency; Decentralized finance; Determinants; FsQCA; Technology adoption","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184145705"

As robots are introduced to project sites, safety, productivity, ease of use, level of robot autonomy, etc. become important parameters for wide-scale adoption; however, research that analyzes the point of view of construction industry stakeholders on adopting robots, to our best knowledge, is still limited. Identifying the expectations and perceptions of different stakeholders about robotic technology is crucial to ensuring the effective utilization the human-robot teams on project sites. This research aimed to study and compare stakeholders' perceptions, levels of trust, and comfort levels in using different robotic technologies on their project sites. Based on these perceptions, this research developed a decision-making framework that will guide industry stakeholders in understanding what steps need to be followed while deciding to robotize a particular task. The research used a questionnaire to collect relevant data from various construction industry stakeholders. The results suggest that these stakeholders have a positive attitude toward the adoption of robots, with drones and layout robots receiving the most favorable response. The top factors that drive robot adoption include a robot's ability to save time by reducing rework and the ability to help in monitoring and quality control. However, factors such as high costs and lack of a skilled workforce were identified as barriers to robot adoption.

This study determines which elements are key to achieve a high impact within companies in the agricultural sector certified as B Corp (B Corporation Certification or CBCs) and their relationship with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda most closely linked to the object of study. A sample of 199 B Corp-certified agribusinesses was selected because it is a widely validated model in the academic world for measuring impact and because it represents a model of a sustainable organization. SDGs 8, 11, 12, and 15, which measure sustainable economic growth and are related to agribusiness (agriculture, forestry, and fisheries), are considered as a basis. Once the criteria established by B Corp certification have been defined, two questions arise: i) Which dimensions (employees, customers, communities, governance, and environment) are relevant for these organizations to have an impact (Presence model)? ii) Which dimensions, when there is no focus by these organizations on the aforementioned criteria, prevent them from generating this impact (Absence model)? Qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to establish which configurations are decisive in determining whether an agribusiness company generates a significant impact, and on which levers the companies should focus their efforts to generate impact. Our results revealed five and three combinations for the presence and assumption model, respectively. Accordingly, the community pillar is the central axis to focus on. Moreover, combined with other dimensions, it will allow the companies to identify their areas of work to maximize their importance for the different stakeholders in line with the selected SDGs. © 2023","B corps certification; Impact and sustainability; Primary sector organizations; SDGs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183461748"

Here, we establish a revised Bordo and Jeanne model (Bordo and Jeanne, 2002) to theoretically verify whether implementation of macro-prudential policies can effectively inhibit the accumulation of financial risks. Subsequently, the China Financial Stress Index is constructed to measure systemic risk. Macro data from January 2009 to December 2022 were selected, and the non-linear relationship between macro-prudential policy tools and systemic risk in the digital finance context was analysed using principal component analysis and the Markov-switching vector autoregressive model. The analysis shows that development of digital finance exacerbates systemic financial risks, and strong regulations are more conducive to restraining systemic financial risk. Thus, development of digital finance significantly affects the impact of macro-prudential policy regulation. Further, this study provides policy suggestions for standardising development of the digital financial market, improving the systemic risk monitoring and evaluation system, optimising the macro-prudential policy mechanism, and strengthening coordination between macro policies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Digital finance; Effectiveness; Financial stress index; Macro-prudential policies; MS-VAR model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182747190"

To this end, we created a method using techniques like topic modeling and text analysis to sort and group ideas. Then, we tested this method on data from crowdsourcing contests in Italy in 2021. In particular, considering the literature on intermediaries, we focus on intermediation in crowdsourcing to improve the decision-making processes in those initiatives where searching activities are intermediated by digital platforms, besides other human intermediaries. This method makes it easier for seekers to handle multiple ideas, and it also helps them find better-quality ideas. Moreover, from a theoretical point of view, our method could lead to better results in crowdsourcing challenges because it groups ideas based on their content without being influenced by the organizers' pre-existing knowledge or biases. This means that seekers might discover new and unexpected topics or solutions they hadn't thought of before. From a practical standpoint, for managers organizing crowdsourcing events, this method is valuable because it not only saves time and effort but also potentially uncovers innovative and diverse ideas. Additionally, the method includes a feature that shows how much participants interact and share knowledge, thus implementing the concept of “transactivity”, which, to the best of our knowledge, hasn't been used in crowdsourcing studies before. This can help crowdsourcing organizers better understand which contests are more effective at encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing among participants. © 2024 The Authors","Bounded rationality; Crowd-driven innovation; Crowdsourcing; Idea filtering; Intermediary; Intermediation; Topic modeling; Transactivity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185194185"

Blockchain's fundamental characteristics - immutability, decentralization, and transparency - promote an excessive reliance on historical data. This reliance, in turn, leads to inaccurate predictions and misguides consumer privacy preferences. The paper contends that this stern protection conflicts with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We argue that the lack of choice in managing data denies freedom, causing psychological reactance. Additionally, the dependence on past data contributes to an intensified privacy paradox as consumers need to assert accurate privacy preferences. These combined effects result in increased consumer digital vulnerability, which arises from an imbalanced power dynamic in data management. We propose a novel approach, which we call “modified blockchain”. The approach is based on three pillars: i) selective immutability, ii) federal decentralization, and iii) supervised transparency. These pillars aim to effectively integrate regulations, organizations, and end-users within advocating for a socio-technical decision-making approach. This work also broadens the scope of the psychological reactance theory and the privacy paradox literature by affirming that a lack of autonomy in data management leads to digital vulnerability. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Blockchain; Digital vulnerability; Federal decentralization; Privacy paradox; Psychological reactance; Selective immutability; Supervised transparency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183952712"

This creates a challenging decision for manufacturers in need of transition: should they build a new carbon-neutral production line or only upgrade the existing production line? We formulate the key tradeoffs including the varying consumer evaluations, the production quality control, and the reform of the supply chain structure. We find that building a new carbon-neutral production line is preferred when the carbon emission level is moderate, the market competition is intensified, and the recycling efficiency is high.

Mechanism verification shows that Digital transformation (DT) enhances CEP through ‘green technology upgrading’, ‘increasing external media attention’ and ‘enhancing internal management control’ effects.

Enterprise digital transformation is a strategic response to the evolving demands of the Information Age, which reshapes business processes and reduces energy consumption. This paper empirically investigates the impact of enterprise digital transformation on low-carbon urban development, based on matched “firm-city” data covering the period 2006–2020. The SBM-DDF model is employed to assess low-carbon urban development, and the text mining approach is utilized to calculate the digital transformation index of enterprises. The results indicate that enterprise digital transformation significantly facilitates low-carbon urban development and the primary mechanisms involve fostering green technology innovation, increasing the scale of green investment, and driving the transformation of industrial structure. This promotional effect is positively reinforced by government environmental concerns, government environmental subsidies, and fintech development. Additionally, the positive impact of digital transformation on low-carbon development occurs more predominantly in regions with lower levels of industrialization and marketization, and this effect becomes more evident after the digital transformation wave. By establishing a micro-level empirical foundation, this paper aims to contribute to digital transformation strategic decision-making within enterprises, while also offering a tangible and feasible pathway for advancing low-carbon urban transformation initiatives. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Enterprise digital transformation; Low-carbon urban development; SBM-DDF model; Text mining","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184149680"

Based on panel data for 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2022, this study examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on manufacturing employment in China using the two-way fixed-effect model and the instrumental variable method. The study finds that contrary to the traditional impression of “machines replacing humans,” AI technology is correlated with increasing the total number of jobs on the market. Thanks to more efficient labor productivity, capital deepening, and specialized division of labor from integrating digital technology, AI offsets the negative effect of robots on employment and significantly increases manufacturing enterprises’ market size and production scale, with a significant job creation effect. Heterogeneity is evident in the positive impact of AI on employment, which has increased the number of jobs in labor-intensive industries and for female workers. Regions with more complete digital infrastructure construction exhibit stronger job creation effects. Mechanism research reveals that the geographical agglomeration mode of traditional industries are undergoing evolutionary transitions under the transformation of digital technology, and modern industrial agglomeration represented by virtual agglomeration is an indispensable mediating mechanism for AI to create jobs. The study’s conclusions can alleviate citizen’s concerns regarding AI crowding-out jobs, encouraging workers and policymakers to make full use of AI technology to improve employment in the digital economy era. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Creative effect; Industrial robot; Labor market; Machines replacing humans; Technological unemployment; Virtual agglomeration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185330401"

To improve our understanding of AI fundraisers, this study recruited 654 adults from an online crowdsourcing platform and developed six chatbot agents (emotional vs. factual × no image vs. machinelike image vs. human image). First, we employed an independent samples t-test to examine the effect of chatbots' conversational style on willingness to donate to Ukraine war victims. This study also tested the mediating roles (independent and serial) of perceived humanness and empathy toward victims in the relationship between chatbots' emotional expression and willingness to donate by conducting a serial multiple mediation analysis. Finally, this study tested the moderating role of visual cues (no image vs. machinelike image vs. human image) by conducting a moderated serial multiple mediation analysis. The results revealed that emotional chatbots yield a higher willingness to donate, and perceived humanness and empathy toward victims mediate this relationship independently and serially.

In light of these developments, we developed a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and a consumer value typology centred around consumer experiences to examine the influence of experiential factors on the intention to use ChatGPT and subsequently collaborating with it for co-creating content among business managers. To test this model, we conducted a survey of 195 business managers in the UK and employed partial PLS-structural equation modelling for analysis. Our findings indicate that the efficiency, excellence, meaningfulness of recommendations, and conversational ability of ChatGPT will influence the behavioural intention to use it during the priori acceptance stage.

This has been enabled by digital technologies developed under the umbrella of Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that automate operations of systems, allowing functioning with changing data. However, many production systems that were hitherto used to significant human intervention and offline computations are struggling to adapt to this digital trend. CONWIP, short for constant work-in-progress (WIP), is a pull mechanism widely used in operations of manufacturing and supply chains to place thresholds on WIP inventory, while delivering high production rates. Traditional approaches for CONWIP control malfunction in the digitized world, as they require optimization models that are slow and further need significant offline human intervention. A digital approach, on the other hand, is expected to be resilient, i.e., use only basic shopfloor data and deliver results quickly and automatically in real time. Hence, this paper seeks a digital approach for deriving and implementing CONWIP thresholds. To the best of knowledge, existing literature does not provide any CONWIP thresholds and/or updating algorithms needed in the digital setting of a CPS jobshop. First, closed-form formulas for CONWIP thresholds, requiring only basic shopfloor data without any simulation/optimization but suitable for incorporation into a digital hardware, are derived. Second, a machine-learning approach is developed for integrating the proposed formulas, thereby enabling seamless data-driven integration and functioning with rapidly changing data. Computational experiments show the proposed digital data-driven approach to closely approximate results from an offline optimization methodology in real time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","CONWIP; CPS; Digitization; IoT; Jobshop","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185198808"

The government, which has a stake in every innovation, should respond by providing a favorable business environment. Metaverse companies, for their part, need to measure the efficiency of the innovation process and the rationality of resource allocation to sustain its competitive edge. However, the relationship between government subsidies (GS) and companies' innovation efficiency is unclear. Based on a three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and a Tobit-regression model, this study analyzes the relationship between government subsidies and innovation efficiency accounting for the influence of environmental variables on innovation performance. There were several main findings: (1) Using a three-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, the first-stage efficiency is far from the production frontier. After removing external environmental variables and random disturbance factors, the third stage efficiency increased notably due to the increase of pure technical efficiency. Government support and regional innovation atmosphere positively influence the innovation efficiency. This paper further classifies the 119 companies into four categories based on pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. (2) Drawing upon the Tobit-regression model, the paper reveals that government subsidies have positive influence on the innovation efficiency of metaverse listed companies. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of government subsidies in innovation efficiency and their important implications for policymakers. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Government subsidies; Innovation efficiency; Metaverse listed companies; Three-stage DEA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184521472"

Efficient, responsible and reflective design of urban spaces is essential to progress towards sustainable urbanism and to improve life quality and the response to users' needs. Especially with the increasing complexity of today's urban systems. For these different reasons, design, analysis and evaluation methods must be adapted and take into account all the layers constituting the urban system.

We define the structure whereby we develop the Uses Potential, i.e., on the basis of three elements constituting the urban systems: the spatial environment, the proposed content in its built components and its relative population. Then we review the technical content of the components on which the Uses Potential is based.

Global institutions have manifested the critical need to develop reasonable strategies in every sector to mitigate the impending issues of excessive anthropogenic carbon emission and, in consequence, climate change. World‑leading economies have initiated significant steps by developing zero‑carbon emission policies to monitor the escalating carbon emissions to curb global warming. The clothing industry has a substantial carbon footprint while causing environmental pollution. Based on transition management theory, this study aims to explore and evaluate the critical determinants that can assist in pursuing carbon neutrality in the clothing industry. A decision support system comprising an integrated voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP) and Bayesian network (BN) method fulfills our purpose. Pertinent literature is reviewed to determine the critical determinants for carbon neutrality (CDs-CN). After that, the VAHP method is employed to prioritize the CDs-CN. Further, the influence of CDs-CN on achieving carbon neutrality is modeled using a BN, predicting the carbon neutrality index (CNI) for the clothing industry. The findings reveal that professional expertise, laws and certifications, technological acceptance, availability of decarbonizing methods, and adequate carbon offsetting are the essential CDs-CN. This research extends the existing knowledge on integrating MCDM-ML techniques to address predictive modelling-based problems involving complex structures. Simultaneously, the present study helps practitioners and policymakers understand the key CDs-CN to successfully build and manage a carbon-neutral clothing industry by adopting the suggested strategies. Finally, recommendations concerning sustainable development goals (SDGs) are provided to achieve carbon-neutral manufacturing supply chains. © 2024 The Authors","Bayesian network; Carbon neutrality; Supply chain; Sustainable development goal (SDG); Technology acceptance; Voting analytical hierarchy process","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184136904"

Second, we show that between-firm wage dispersion increased more in sectors that experienced an increase in productivity dispersion; the estimated elasticity is larger at the bottom than at the top of the wage/productivity distributions, consistent with a framework in which more productive firms charge higher mark-ups and/or larger wage mark-downs. Third, we find that both globalisation and digitalisation strengthen the link between productivity and wage dispersion.

With the consideration of regional heterogeneity, we propose the dynamic network data envelopment analysis (DEA) models based on convex and nonconvex metafrontiers to measure the metatechnology-specific technical efficiency (MTE), group-specific technical efficiency (GTE) and technology gap ratio (TGR) of the overall system and subsystems. The proposed models are empirically applied to assess the efficiency of funding to support rural revitalization and regional heterogeneity of technologies for 31 provinces in China during 2017–2020.

To address such issues, there is an urgent need for healthcare organizations like hospitals to build new capabilities. We suggest using organizational information processing theory (OIPT) as theoretical foundation for developing research model that investigates how healthcare 4.0 technologies (big data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain) enhance hospital supply chain processes and thereby the performance. According to our analysis of survey data from around 255 hospital managers in Indian hospitals, the three hospital supply chain processes, viz., operations, innovations, and risk management, and the supply chain performance are significantly impacted by these healthcare 4.0 technologies. Additionally, hospital supply chain operations and innovations partially mediate the association between healthcare 4.0 technologies and performance. We also found, the interaction between healthcare 4.0 technologies and hospital supply chain operations is moderated by type of healthcare organizations (private, and public hospitals). In addition to extending and validating the OIPT in context of digital hospital supply chains, these findings offer healthcare professionals empirical evidence to further maximize the benefits of healthcare 4.0 technologies for sustained hospital supply chain performance and integrate digital supply management into health system development. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Healthcare 4.0 technologies; Hospital supply chain processes; Organizational information processing theory (OIPT); Performance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184523140"

How to recommend live streams to viewers to improve user experience is the core business problem of live streaming platforms. On such platforms, viewers frequently change live streams to watch in each session for the enjoyment of the watching process. Live interaction along with streaming, which enables broadcasters and viewers to better connect with each other, is a core feature of live streaming and plays important roles in viewers' watching behaviors. How to model the changing process of viewer preference during each watching behavior and capture the influence of live interaction is key for understanding viewer behaviors and making effective recommendations of live streams but has not been well studied in the literature. To address this research gap, we incorporate user behavior theory into data driven modeling method and propose an interaction-aware predictive framework for live stream recommendation. Specifically, we develop a novel threshold-based modeling framework to systematically model viewers' watching behaviors. Guided by the theory of hedonic decline, we further model the process of viewers' preference decline during watching each live stream with consideration of live interactions, shedding light on the roles of different kinds of live interactions on viewers' watching behaviors. Comprehensive experiments conducted on a real-world data set demonstrate that our proposed framework can enhance both watching duration prediction and live stream recommendation.

Noteworthily, these factors vary significantly among the three firms. Larger firms, often operating in an environment with high AI penetration, primarily perceive the operating affordance of AI rather than marketing affordance. This means their AI adoption encompasses greater scale and depth than smaller firms. However, this expansive adoption exposes them to a widening gap in regulatory frameworks, hindering AI adoption. Moreover, smaller firms are characterized by weaker AI readiness, positioning them disadvantageously to mitigate the constraints imposed by AI.

A systematic review of 1342 papers identified 331 that focused on metaverse technology, with 40 providing empirical evidence about the metaverse's impacts. The results indicate that organizational and behavioral factors affect metaverse applications in healthcare, marketing, operations management, sustainable development, and supply chain management.

We propose that, within the context of organizational performance, the practice-based view theory offers a more comprehensive understanding of metaverse outcomes. Moreover, the social exchange theory can explain users' attitudes toward privacy and security more insightfully. This paper recommends that future research should provide empirical evidence on the metaverse, focusing on organizational capabilities (e.g., absorptive capacity and power structure) and behavioral aspects (e.g., privacy concerns and confidence).

To contribute to this evolving field, this study examines three factors that might play significant roles in enhancing trust in algorithms: familiarity with algorithms, familiarity with tasks, and familiarity with algorithm performance. Drawing upon prior studies, a conceptual model was developed and empirically tested using a scenario study. Data on 327 individuals showed a strong positive association between familiarity with algorithms and trust in algorithms. In contrast, task familiarity appeared to have no significant influence on trust. Trust, in turn, was identified as a key driver of algorithm appreciation. The study also revealed the moderating role of familiarity with algorithm performance in the relationship between familiarity with algorithms and trust in algorithms. Post hoc analysis highlighted that trust fully mediates the relationship between algorithm familiarity and algorithm appreciation. The study underscores the significance of algorithm familiarity and performance transparency in shaping trust in algorithms.

Due to the innovative characteristics of decentralization, transparency, immutability, and anonymity, blockchain applications break new ground for users' decision-making in an operations environment. There is a lack of evidence regarding herding in blockchain technology in general and its potential effect on blockchain application platforms in particular. In response to this new technological phenomenon, we studied whether and how herding behaviors take place in the context of blockchain applications for operations in this research. We propose two new variables related to the operation of the blockchain application (i.e., technical assurance and decentralized management efforts) and a new variable related to user identity (i.e., identifiability). We found evidence of the existence of herding by utilizing the objective data of approximately 0.1 million transactions on a leading blockchain application platform providing self-service and collateral-based lending services. Our empirical findings also reveal that technical assurance and decentralized management efforts reduce users' herding tendencies. Moreover, we found that the higher the identifiability, the lower the users' herding tendency, and the less they are affected by technical assurance and decentralized management efforts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Decentralization; Herding; Identifiability; Technical assurance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185156061"

This paper introduces the concept of CSD, which occurs when an internet-connected smartphone competes for a customer's attention during a consumption goal-oriented task or behavior. Based on a three-stage research process involving a systematic literature review and an expert opinion survey with a multi-disciplinary lens to better understand this phenomenon, we develop a conceptual framework underpinned by Cognitive – Affective Personality System (CAPS) Theory that incorporates the antecedents, contingency variables, and consequences of CSD. Our findings suggest that CSD is a complex phenomenon influenced by both environmental stimuli, such as audio and visual notifications, and internal psychological states, such as boredom and anxiety, which are interdependent factors that contribute to CSD. Interestingly, the absence of environmental stimuli alone may not reduce CSD. To deal with this issue, customers need to take responsibility for their consumption behavior, while businesses, society and policy makers can assist customers through better education and design of mobile device experiences. Overall, we highlight the need for a deeper understanding of CSD and its impact on customer behavior and well-being, and outline implications to assist researchers, practitioners, policy makers and society broadly to deal with CSD. © 2023 The Authors","Customer wellbeing; Distraction; Smartphone; Systematic literature review","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175542564"

Technology was seen as neutral and accessible, with market forces and multilateral states enforcing global trading norms. However, recent years have witnessed a shift as technological powers turn interdependencies into vulnerabilities. The intense technological competition between China and the U.S. has exposed the non-neutrality of technology, resulting in geopolitical tensions and strategic market exclusions. The impact of technology on global politics extends beyond a single sector, affecting policies, laws, governance, security, international relations, economics, and human rights. This intersection of technology and global politics forms the basis of GTP, where political decisions and actions are influenced by technological advancements, and vice versa. Understanding the landscape of GTP is therefore crucial for individuals, organizations, and states to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the digital age while ensuring technology serves the public interest. The present study seeks to deepen our understanding of GTP and its implications by reviewing the extant IS research and providing opportunities for future research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Conflict; Global techno-politics; Information privacy and security; Policies and standards; Social media","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179181036"

For this aim, a structural equation approach is adopted among 95 Tunisian professional respondents operating in technology-based sectors. The findings stipulate the importance of facilitating conditions and performance expectancy as drivers of the adoption intention. Additionally, the study reveals that trust in technology is significant in its mediating role in influencing the intention of adoption with the facilitating conditions and the social influence constructs. Moreover, the paper uncovers a direct relationship with the same variable.

Additionally, comments and attribute ratings have different magnitudes in reflecting customer overall satisfaction and online recommendation. Such asymmetric reflection varies across three-level hierarchical temporal lenses, including the COVID-19 pandemic (macro-institutional level), customer waiting time resulted from service failures (meso-organizational level), and the temporal contiguity between the customer consumption time and review posting time (micro-individual level). The three-level hierarchical temporal lenses negatively moderate the reflection of attribute-level ratings and comments on customer overall satisfaction but positively moderate the reflection of attribute-level ratings and comments on customer recommendation. Our findings offer valuable insights for managers, helping them comprehend the significance of temporal lenses in shaping customer online review behavior and the asymmetric reflection of consumer perceptions and behaviors stemming from online reviews.

We trace the effect of increased access and speeds across industrial sectors and firm sizes. Our results highlight that increases in broadband speeds can improve the financial performance of adopting small firms (sales, profits and labour productivity) by 2% for every speed doubling beyond basic broadband access. Unlike other output metrics, small firms do not generate increasing shares of intangible capital through this adoption process. These effects, which remain strong across a range of robustness checks, suggest that the digital transition for small firms should focus on the causes of adoption (including training and skill development) and move beyond policies aimed at increased broadband availability alone. © 2023 The Authors.

Scholars and practitioners have pointed to user resistance as a potential hindrance to their adoption. This mixed-methods study examines how managerial perceptions of expected employee resistance and organizational value are related to organizational adoption intention. An organizational-level resistance-value adoption model was developed and tested using the structural equation modeling approach with cross-sectional data from 206 European industrial decision makers. The results show that trialability, internal support capabilities, and extant user skills are negatively associated with expected employee resistance. Moreover, mimetic pressures strongly influence value perceptions, whereas expected employee resistance is negatively related to organizational value perceptions and adoption intentions. Perceived value had the strongest positive relationship with adoption intention. A qualitative study consisting of 58 interviews further revealed 12 key conditions affecting the relationships between resistance, value, and adoption intention.

This study evaluates the effects of future climate on the energy demand of an office building in Portugal and proposes mitigation measures to improve its energy performance and environmental sustainability. The study simulates the energy demand of the building in 2055 and 2090 under different future scenarios using data from the latest climate model experiments, considering systems, envelopes, and operations interventions, and assesses the potential of photovoltaic panels to meet the energy demand. The results show that the interventions may reduce electric energy consumption between 16 % and 25 %, and the photovoltaic panels can meet 23 %–59 % of the total demand, depending on the scenario and the year. However, storage technology and equipment efficiency must evolve favorably to reach low energy. The findings reveal if a building designed and optimized for the current climate will remain optimal in the future and demonstrate the benefits of applying cleaner production and sustainable consumption principles to the office building sector.

While it provides benefits like personalized recommendations and 24/7 assistance, there are limitations, like difficulty in understanding unconventional language. The paper stresses careful integration to overcome these limitations and create a better customer experience. Additionally, it discusses the potential for further development and integration of ChatGPT in retail, such as generating product descriptions and virtual try-on experiences. Finally, the paper encourages retailers to embrace ChatGPT to meet their customer needs. Design/methodology/approach: Case-based methodology involves using specific cases or examples to explore a broader issue or phenomenon. Researchers have analysed real-world cases to identify patterns, themes and insights that can be applied to other contexts or situations. This was useful for understanding complex and multifaceted issues as it allowed us to delve deeper into specific examples and explore the nuances of the situation. Findings: While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for retailers, limitations such as difficulty in understanding non-standard accents and unconventional language can arise, causing customer frustration. Retail managers must integrate ChatGPT in a way that enhances customer experience. In the future, ChatGPT has the potential to generate product descriptions, provide virtual try-on experiences and integrate with augmented or virtual reality technology to offer more immersive experiences. Careful consideration and integration can help retailers overcome these limitations and offer personalized recommendations, round-the-clock assistance and an engaging customer experience that improves sales.

While this form of artificial intelligence offers numerous advantages, adverse outcomes can arise when customers’ expectations of VAs are not met. This paper examines how the disconfirmation of both parasocial interactions with the VA and its anthropomorphic characteristics affects users’ dissatisfaction with the VA. Such dissatisfaction might then influence subsequent behavioural outcomes, specifically spreading negative word-of-mouth about the VA (NWOMVA) and avoiding future use of VAs. Data were gathered from VA users in Egypt and the UAE via an online questionnaire. The findings from the two studies confirm that all direct hypotheses were supported and that dissatisfaction with VAs mediates the relationships between both negative parasocial interaction disconfirmation (NPID) and negative VA anthropomorphism disconfirmation and the behavioural outcomes of NWOMVA and VA avoidance. Thus, this paper offers managers guidelines on the effective characteristics of VAs, namely anthropomorphism and parasocial interaction, which allow them to identify the pitfalls of VAs and take preventive or remedial actions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropomorphism; Avoidance; Dissatisfaction; Negative word-of-mouth; Parasocial interaction; Virtual agent","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176241651"

Digitalization and automatization of business processes are treated by many employees as a potential threat to their jobs. The digital skills gap is one of the main barriers to the successful implementation of digital strategies in many companies. Thus, the upskilling of the staff is one of the urgent needs and, simultaneously, issues (due to the staff resistance) in the path towards successful digital transformation. The goal of the article is to gain a deeper understanding of the intensity and scope of research in the field of personnel training in the context of digital transformation on a global and Latvian scale. The article provides the results of the bibliometric analysis, based on 2109 papers published in 2000-2023 in the sources indexed by SCOPUS. Visualization was made by the application of VOSviewer tools. The analysis yielded five clusters that combine 177 terms – namely, “Digital transformation and technologies”, “Human resources and innovation”, “Education and learning”, “Higher education and the Pandemic”, and “Information technologies and competencies”. Besides, the authors analysed the content of 41 defended doctoral dissertations by Ph.D. students of Latvian Universities in 2012-2023. As a result of the examination, it became evident that the practical solutions put forth are largely disconnected from the focus of this research. This, in turn, indicates the need for an in-depth investigation of the above-mentioned concepts, namely-productivity, motivation, and mitigating resistance in the context of business digital transformation. © 2024, The London Academy of Science and Business.

This research examines the relative persuasiveness of two endorsement styles, that is, explicit endorsement (e.g., “I recommend it”) and implicit endorsement (e.g., “I love it”). Drawing on the persuasion knowledge model, we propose that explicit endorsements are less persuasive than implicit endorsements because the former trigger stronger persuasion knowledge. We further argue that source trustworthiness mitigates the persuasion effect difference between the two endorsement styles. This article assesses these hypotheses across different sources (anonymous reviewers, friends, influencers), channels (online community, social commerce platform, social networking app), and products (hotels, restaurants) using secondary data analysis and two experiments. Three studies provide support for our hypotheses.

First, little empirical evidence has been produced to examine the deployment of chatbots in government contexts. Second, existing research does not distinguish clearly between the drivers of adoption and the determinants of success and, therefore, between the stages of adoption and implementation. Third, most current research does not use a multidimensional perspective to understand the adoption and implementation of AI in government organizations. Our study addresses these gaps by exploring the following question: what determinants facilitate or impede the adoption and implementation of chatbots in the public sector? We answer this question by analyzing 22 state agencies across the U.S.A. that use chatbots. Our analysis identifies ease of use and relative advantage of chatbots, leadership and innovative culture, external shock, and individual past experiences as the main drivers of the decisions to adopt chatbots. Further, it shows that different types of determinants (such as knowledge-base creation and maintenance, technology skills and system crashes, human and financial resources, cross-agency interaction and communication, confidentiality and safety rules and regulations, and citizens’ expectations, and the COVID-19 crisis) impact differently the adoption and implementation processes and, therefore, determine the success of chatbots in a different manner. Future research could focus on the interaction among different types of determinants for both adoption and implementation, as well as on the role of specific stakeholders, such as IT vendors. © The Author(s) 2023.","AI adoption; AI implementation; artificial intelligence; Chatbot; innovation adoption; innovation implementation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170831025"

The current research body illustrates that different methodologies have been used to investigate how digitalisation (DI) affects business results. We investigated the link between the DI and sustainable corporate performance (SCP) of SMEs in an emerging economy environment via the lens of green innovation (GI) and green supply chain management (GSCM). As the aforesaid coupled linkage and its influence on sustainability had hitherto not been discussed in the literature, we focused on the mediating role played by GI and GSCM in the relationship between DI and SCP. We employed a quantitative methodology and gathered data through a carefully designed questionnaire administered to senior and medium managers. This yielded 405 valid replies. We then analysed the data by using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results were found to indicate a positive relationship between DI, GI, GSCM, and SCP.

An index of economic situation at the household level allowed us to measure that economic inequality persists between poor and rich households. Also, probabilistic regression models were used to validate the relationship between household wealth and digital economy participation. The models showed the gap remained practically at the same level between the two years; 26% in favour of the richest households. Educational level, age and experience in using the Internet were confirmed as the main differentiators in the condition of participation in the digital economy. The lack of progress observed in this research raises alarm bells about the lag of the poorest households in the productive use of the Internet and in the scope of its potential benefits.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of technology management (TM) and its practices through process and maintenance technologies on sustainability performance (SP) for petroleum refineries and petrochemical companies in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: A new proposed framework has been developed for a clearer understanding in relation to these aspects. The study was conducted among Egyptian refineries and petrochemical companies. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 65 petroleum experts and professionals, which was then summarized using statistical analysis, hypothesis testing and regression analysis. Findings: The findings demonstrate that TM has a significant and direct impact on SP. Furthermore, the study shows that process technology (PT) has a positive influence on the three aspects of SP. Although maintenance technology has a positive impact on economic and environmental sustainability, it shows no direct effect on social sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The degree to which TM and sustainability principles are implemented across petroleum companies in various countries varies significantly because of managerial and cultural dimensions. Therefore, when conducting the research, it is important to consider the study’s geographical area to comprehend how these practices are impacted by the distinctive managerial and cultural settings of each country. Also, respondents in developing countries do not participate in such surveys with much enthusiasm. Practical implications: The study shows that implementing TM practices generates more economic stability and ensures environmental and social sustainability. The research studied how PT and maintenance practices affected each aspect of sustainability. These findings can apply to all downstream oil companies, regardless of their size or type of operations. Further research can be conducted to examine the relationship between variables in other industries. Social implications: Decision-makers and managers may use the study's findings to improve their companies' performance and develop new plans and policies. The results demonstrate that companies will have a greater chance of achieving sustainable performance if they incorporate process and maintenance technologies into their activities. Besides economic and environmental sustainability, petroleum companies must strive for social sustainability. Originality/value: The study is regarded as a significant contribution to the management of petroleum refineries and petrochemical companies, as it combined TM practices with SP in a single research framework.

These changes will improve effectiveness, business models, and customer relationships. However, firms confront several barriers when they embark on their DT journey. Thus, it is essential to understand how the barriers can be tackled by countermeasures. Understanding the qualities of these countermeasures is critical for businesses to overcome barriers. Thus, this current study searches for similarities and differences across sociodemographic categories representing company size (LE, MLE, SME), level of responsibility (executive, with and without personal responsibility), and age (under 30, 31-40, 41-50, above 50).

Design/methodology/approach: This research paper uses a specialised two stage estimator, the panel instrumental variable technique (panel IV), which takes care of the potential endogeneity issues in the model. Findings: The findings show that natural gas rent significantly impacts the economic growth of the GECF. On average, natural gas rent increases the sample’s growth rate by about 2.634% percentage points in the short run. The result indicates that the qualities of institutions (political and economic) have a significant positive long-term effect on the economies of the GECF. In addition, the study’s energy price volatility positively correlates with the countries’ growth. Research limitations/implications: There might be a need to investigate the effects of natural gas rents and institutions as co-growth drivers in each country within the GECF. The likelihood exists that the impact of natural gas rents and institutions on economic growth at the country’s level may differ from the outcome of such an experiment on the group level. Because of space and time limitations, this study could not carry out the specific country’s investigation of natural gas rents and institutions as a co-growth driver. That limitation may constitute further study to advance this study to a new height. Practical implications: With good institutions, natural gas rent is likely to be an alternative growth driver for some economies that rely on fossil fuels like oil as a growth driver. By extension, the GECF has the potential to rival Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the global energy market, particularly in achieving Sustainable Development Goal number seven. In essence, evidence in this study suggests that natural gas rent has long-term positive effects on the growth of the GECF, conditioned on good institutions. Moreover, the drive of global energy consumption towards sustainable energy usage is an economic blessing for the GECF. By extension, the demand for natural gas would continue to rise, creating opportunities to improve natural gas rents. By implication, the GECF would continue to benefit from the pursuit of sustainability as the world shifts towards energy consumption with less CO2. Originality/value: Firstly, this study models the qualities of institutions for the GECF. Secondly, to the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first attempt to examine natural gas rents and the qualities of institutions as co-determinants of economic growth among the GECF (a potential cartel). © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CO<sub>2</sub> emission; Dynamic regression; Econometric model; Energy production; Energy sector; Focus groups; Natural gas rents; Two-stage least square estimation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158097455"

However, the obstacles to this transformation are numerous and interrelated. The objective of this article is to shed light on the nature of these obstacles in the Moroccan context. Based on a survey of 312 Moroccan companies and 74 interviews, this study made it possible to determine the major obstacles to digital transformation. The major barriers to digital transformation are essentially the lack of internal resources and skills, resistance to change and lack of leadership, insufficient return on investment, the strategic and procedural complexity of the project, security problems, and the inconsistency of the transformation project to be carried out. These results confirm those obtained by other studies under other skies, thus making it possible to conclude that the nature of the obstacles to digital transformation remains practically the same in the different countries covered by similar research, but only the degree of their prevalence changes.

Few scholars have investigated the factors that influence the purchase behaviors of Black millennial consumers (BMC). Persistent discrimination in retail spaces creates psychological effects leaving BMCs in potentially harmful environments that may alter their consciousness. The racialized environment is central in the conceptualization of Black Critical Theory and W.E.B Du Bois’ double consciousness. Through these lenses, we investigate BMCs’ shopping experiences, in-store perceptions, and purchase intentions in retail spaces. Semi-structured interviews with 10 consumers who self-identified as Black and millennial were conducted. Situations of double consciousness are revealed and explored in the context of shopping in retail spaces.

Although AI has been utilized in numerous areas for several years, the emergence of generative AI (GAI) applications such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or DALL-E are considered a breakthrough for the acceleration of AI technology due to their ease of use, intuitive interface, and performance. With GAI, it is possible to create a variety of content such as texts, images, audio, code, and even videos. This creates a variety of implications for businesses requiring a deeper examination, including an influence on business model innovation (BMI). Therefore, this study provides a BMI perspective on GAI with two primary contributions: (1) The development of six comprehensive propositions outlining the impact of GAI on businesses, and (2) the discussion of three industry examples, specifically software engineering, healthcare, and financial services. This study employs a qualitative content analysis using a scoping review methodology, drawing from a wide-ranging sample of 513 data points. These include academic publications, company reports, and public information such as press releases, news articles, interviews, and podcasts. The study thus contributes to the growing academic discourse in management research concerning AI's potential impact and offers practical insights into how to utilize this technology to develop new or improve existing business models. © The Author(s) 2023.","Artificial intelligence; Business model innovation; ChatGPT; Generative AI; Large language models; M10; M13; M15; M19","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171188382"

The cases were set in tourism, construction, as well as manufacturing and were each scientifically accompanied for more than one year during the identification of implementation of strategies for data spaces as digital entrepreneurial path. Findings: The study shows four strategies in the implementation of data spaces in traditional wholesale. These data spaces have their focus in (1) the traded commodity with two specificities (1a and 1b), (2) the customer and (3) the cooperation of an ecosystem of companies.

The investigation concentrated on Malaysian consumers who have experience using online food delivery (OFD) applications. Design/methodology/approach: To perform the research, non-probability and convenience sampling methods were enforced to gather the required data. An online questionnaire in the form of a Google Survey was conducted in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Upon completion of the survey, the results were analyzed using SPSS software. Both the Service Quality (SERVQUAL) model and expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT) were exploited to shed light on the impact of consumer satisfaction. Findings: Analysis of responses from the 250 participants unveiled that novelty-seeking positively influences consumer satisfaction. The finding depicted that reliability and responsiveness have the most positive impact on consumer satisfaction whereas tangibility has no effect on the satisfaction of consumers by using OFD applications. Research limitations/implications: This study had three main limitations: first, the limitations on access to the participants during the pandemic; second, combining quantitative and qualitative methods to obtain more accurate results; third, the study was limited to the context of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Practical implications: The conclusions brought to the fore that OFD marketers should provide appropriate service quality while concentrating on novelty and well-designed apps to surge consumer satisfaction. Originality/value: OFD apps have facilitated customers' access to various meals and helped food vendors survive in the competitive marketplace. A new aspect, novelty-seeking, is added to the SERVQUAL dimensions (i.e. empathy, tangibility, reliability, assurance and responsiveness) identified in the literature review. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; E-commerce; E-Satisfaction and e-loyalty; Malaysia; SERVQUAL model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176911551"

First, at the conceptual level, it proposes an original combinatory outlook on value creation and value appropriation to account for the diversity of profit trajectories in the context of retail digitalization. Second, at the empirical level, it gathers essential information concerning the mutation of the sector based on a comparative analysis of the strategies and trajectories of Walmart—the industry leader—and two of its main challengers since the mid-nineties: the main historical rival, Carrefour, and the new entrant, Amazon. Stylized facts about their respective financial trajectories and a description of their engagement with digitalization enable the identification and the interpretation of their distinct dynamics.

The proposed model is suitable for the case of countries, especially developing countries, with limited data. The calculations and analysis give three main results. Firstly, the scale of Vietnam's core economy has increased rapidly over the past 14 years. In 2007, the share of the core economy in GDP was only 1.45%. In 2019, this number increased to 7.08%. Second, the scale of Vietnam's digitalized economy grew significantly from 2007 to 2019. In 2007–2011, the digitalized economy accounted for 4.90% of GDP. This number increased to 11.56% for the period 2016–2019. Third, the growth of the digitalized economy is mainly based on the growth of the core digital economy. Therefore, the digital spillover effect in Vietnam's digitalized economy during the 13 years has only slightly changed.

Drawing upon insights from the digital literacy framework, we propose a platform literacy framework that can be applied in practical settings. Methodologically, we conducted an extensive review of 735 research papers on digital literacies to gather definitions and frameworks. As a result, we identified seven core constructs and three main proficiencies that constitute the platform literacy framework.

However, successfully operating AI is a complex endeavor requiring organizations to establish adequate management approaches. Managing AI applications requires functioning information exchange between a diverse set of stakeholders. Lacking information processing among stakeholders increases task uncertainty, hampering the operation of AI applications. Existing research lacks an understanding of holistic AI management approaches. To shed light on AI management in healthcare, we conducted a multi-perspective literature analysis followed by an interview study. Based on the organizational information processing theory, this paper investigates AI management in healthcare from an organizational perspective. As a result, we develop the AI application management model (AIAMA) that illustrates the managerial factors of AI management in healthcare and its interrelations. Furthermore, we provide managerial practices that improve information processing among stakeholders. We contribute to the academic discourse by providing a conceptual framework that increases the theoretical understanding of AI's management factors and understanding of management interrelations.

To better understand the factors that contribute to this fear, the authors conducted research on the impact of various obstacles, such as limited financial resources, risk aversion, stress and hard work avoidance, and prior business failures. Additionally, the authors explored the effects of social capital in mitigating these obstacles and their relationship to fear of failure in entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a survey with 440 young Iraqi entrepreneurs using non-probabilistic and purposive methods. The survey instrument included multiple measuring scales, which were provided in both English and Arabic. The authors analysed valid responses using structural equation modelling (SEM) with partial least squares (PLS). Findings: The findings show that the fear of failure in entrepreneurship is negatively influenced by factors such as limited financial access, risk aversion, and past business failures. However, aversion to stress and hard work did not have a significant impact. The findings also show that social capital could potentially mitigate these negative factors. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical and practical implications of this study manifest in revealing the difficulties entrepreneurs encounter in developing countries like Iraq, where entrepreneurship is vital for economic growth. The study's limitations stem from its focus on one country and the use of a single survey method. Future research could use varied methods across multiple countries for a more comprehensive view.

This study combines the dynamic capabilities theory with the perspective of digital maturity by answering the question, ""What are the capabilities underlying the ability to become a digitally mature organization?"" A systematic review of studies that investigated digital transformation from a maturity perspective was conducted and the findings were consolidated into a conceptual framework structured according to the dynamic capabilities lens. The framework was then compared to insights from case studies of four digitally mature organizations using the flexible pattern-matching approach. As a result, a framework of digital transformation dynamic capability was proposed, consisting of five thematic areas of action: designing and managing transformation, fostering digital value propositions, acting in digital business ecosystems, systematizing structural changes, and supporters and enablers. The main implication of this study is the original approach for consolidating and organizing previous literature on digital transformation that can guide organizations to articulate and develop specific processes and resources to mature digitally, leading to a capacity for continuous change in the perpetually evolving digital landscape. There are also implications for theory building, as the proposed framework can serve as an agenda for future research on dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Business model; Digital maturity; Digital transformation; Dynamic capabilities; Maturity models; O32; Strategy","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171175071"

However, a comprehensive understanding of the pivotal factors driving successful coopetition and their direct influence on business performance remains elusive. This empirical study seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by constructing a hierarchical framework employing a modified Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (M-TISM) approach, further substantiated through rigorous validation via Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and empirical case analysis. Employing a mixed-methods research design, data is systematically gathered from competitor organizations actively immersed in digital transformation initiatives. The M-TISM framework meticulously captures the intricate interplay and relationships among critical factors, thereby facilitating an exhaustive examination of their combined impact on coopetition outcomes and overall performance within the dynamic landscape of digital transformation. The study employs robust statistical analysis through PLS-SEM, ensuring the methodological integrity of the framework. This developed hierarchical framework, grounded in modified Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (M-TISM) and fortified through PLS-SEM validation and empirical case analyses, significantly contributes to the theoretical underpinnings of coopetition. Noteworthy drivers such as organizational culture, knowledge sharing, trust, resource complementarity, and competitive intensity come to the forefront. Furthermore, the study's empirical insights, derived from case analyses, equip practitioners with actionable guidance for strategically harnessing coopetition in the context of digital transformation. Policymakers, armed with these informed perspectives on the impact of coopetition, are better positioned to craft supportive frameworks that promote optimized performance outcomes within the ever-evolving digital landscape. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Case study; Competition; Coopetition; Digital; M-TISM; PLS-SEM","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174336933"

With the ever-increasing digitization of all aspects of life, companies are struggling to keep themselves and their customers secure. This is, at least in part, due to their focus on compliance to standards and regulations, they fall victim to a checkbox-mentality where compliance instead of security is seen as the goal. This strong focus on compliance creates security blind-spots and the negative impact it has on security is strengthened by the “pacing problem” – where technology evolves faster than the law. Thus, leaving a gap where there is a lack of legislation and enforcement for new technologies. In this opinion piece I argue that the responsibility for cybersecurity should be shared by governments and companies. To give companies the tools they need for ethical decision-making and thus truly take responsibility, I suggest combining the ethics of care with stakeholder theory to provide a context-based relational view of companies.

We contribute to the literature debate—mainly focused on robotics and large firms—by analyzing adopters’ labor productivity returns when micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) are concerned. We employ original survey data on Italian MSMEs’ adoption investments related to a multiplicity of technologies and rely on a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. Results highlight that Industry 4.0 technology adoption leads to a 7% increase in labor productivity. However, this effect decreases over time and is highly heterogeneous with respect to the type, the number, and the variety of technologies adopted. We also identify potential channels explaining the labor productivity returns of technology adoption: cost-related efficiency, new knowledge creation, and greater integration/collaboration both within the firm and with suppliers. Plain English Summary: Becoming Industry 4.0 technology adopter boosts Italian manufacturing micro, small, and medium enterprises’ (MSME) labor productivity by more than 7% on average. This is the key finding of new research based on original survey data collected from a sample of MSMEs operating in “Made in Italy” industries. Specifically, the research suggests that brand-new adopters of Industry 4.0 technologies gain a labor productivity premium compared to their non-adopting counterparts that lasts for up to 2 years after the adoption occurred. However, the productivity returns of technology adoption show non-linearities with respect to both the number of new technologies adopted by the firm and the variety of “technology groups” (production, customization, and data processing technologies). Overall, these results point to the relevance of industrial policies promoting the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies by MSMEs, and this seems to be particularly the case for all those countries where MSMEs make the bulk of the national industrial system. © The Author(s) 2023.","Industry 4.0; Italy; J24; L23; L25; Labor productivity; MSME; O32; Technology adoption","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173050566"

The transformation of workplaces whose future promises to be virtual or hybrid can make the anticipation and prevention of these health issues more challenging, considering the potential distance that it may create between employees and their employers. The recent health crisis undermined individual mental health but also highlighted the importance of new technologies which greatly paved the way for the future of workplaces. This paper aims to examine these new technologies, specifically the use of blockchain technologies in organizations to predict and prevent mental health issues at work, specifically psychological distress, in times of crisis, and beyond. It addresses the main challenges and opportunities and presents research avenues as well as insights for human resource management (HRM) practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a viewpoint that addresses the use of blockchain technology in the prevention of employees’ mental health at work in times of crisis and beyond. Literature was used to support this viewpoint and highlight the importance of addressing mental health issues at work and preventing their occurrence in the future. Findings: Blockchain is one of the disruptive new technologies that can be used as a strategic tool for organizations to prevent mental health issues among employees in the workplace in times of crisis, and beyond. It facilitates the collaboration between employees, their organization, healthcare and employee assistance program (EPA) providers, as well as insurance companies. In this context, a specific type of blockchain should be used to support this type of collaboration. Practical implications: Blockchain can generate both opportunities and challenges for the prevention of mental issues at work. It can transform the future of workplaces and help organizations as well as healthcare and EPA providers to anticipate potential employees’ mental health issues in 2019.

Past research suggests that standardization mitigates these challenges, reducing ecosystem-level uncertainty. But how does it affect firm-level uncertainty over value-appropriation? We examine heterogeneity in the latter effect. Using 1996–2010 data on standard-setting in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) ecosystems and a firm-level uncertainty measure based on stock option implied volatility, we demonstrate that while standardization reduces uncertainty for firms that own part of the standardized components, it heightens uncertainty for firms that do not, especially when they face strong rivals in complementary technologies or have fewer complementary technologies or production assets themselves. Findings stress that coordination tools enhancing ecosystem-level value-creation can end up hurting firm-level value-appropriation and worsen uncertainty for some firms in the ecosystem that the tools are meant to help. Managerial Summary: In an ecosystem, a firm faces two types of uncertainty—ecosystem-level uncertainty over how to coordinate with others on developing interoperable parts, and firm-level uncertainty over whether it can occupy a viable position to capture value. Standardization, a commonly touted solution, reduces the former but not necessarily the latter. Using 1996–2010 data on standard setting in ICT ecosystems and stock option implied volatility, we show that for non-standard-owner firms, standardization in fact worsens the latter, especially when they face strong rivals or lack complementary technologies or production assets in areas complementary to the standard. Thus, tools like standardization meant to solve ecosystem-level coordination problems can end up raising more doubts on firms' ability to capture value and discouraging firms from participating instead of promoting ecosystem growth. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","competition; coordination; ecosystem; standardization; uncertainty","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177552482"

It is characterized by creative combination of content creation and product selling, which differs from traditional e-tailing (TE) with product selling alone. Motivated by the real-world practices like social media platforms “TikTok” and douyin.com, we endeavor to study if the SMR model performs better than the TE model in a monopoly setting. By building a stylized economic model, we find that the SMR model does not always outperform the TE model. Specifically, when the SMR platform collects less commission from the seller than the TE platform, the seller, consumers, and the social welfare all benefit more from the SMR model, while the platform benefits more from the SMR model if and only if the creator's social influence is high enough or the cost of content creation is small enough. For the incentive structure of the content rewards in the SMR model, we find that a strong incentive mechanism (e.g., the quadratic form) is more powerful than a weak one (e.g., the linear form). The previous one will encourage the creator to choose a much higher quality level of content creation and meanwhile allow the platform, consumers, and social welfare to become better off. Counterintuitively, providing more generous content rewards is not always helpful for the creator (seller) and it may reduce her profit. Our findings will guide the platform to effectively design incentive mechanisms to boost the content creation and retailing in the SMR model and help the influencers efficiently create contents, engage their followers (fans), and price their products sold on the SMR platform. © 2023","Content creation; Creator economy; Incentive strategy; Platform retailing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179762121"

This approach has proven inadequate, as numerous foreseeable problems arising out of commercial development and applications of AI have harmed vulnerable persons and communities, with few (and sometimes no) opportunities for recourse. Worse problems are highly likely in the future. By requiring quality control measures before AI is deployed, an ex ante approach would often mitigate and sometimes entirely prevent injuries that AI causes or contributes to. Licensing is an important tool of ex ante regulation, and should be applied in many high-risk domains of AI. Indeed, policymakers and even some leading AI developers and vendors are calling for licensure in the area. To substantiate licensing proposals, this article specifies optimal terms of licensure for AI necessary to justify its use. Given both documented and potential harms arising out of high-risk AI systems, licensing agencies should require firms to demonstrate that their AI meets clear requirements for security, non-discrimination, accuracy, appropriateness, and correctability before being deployed. Under this ex ante model of regulation, AI developers would bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that their technology is not discriminatory, not manipulative, not unfair, not inaccurate, and not illegitimate in its lawful bases and purposes. While the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can provide key benchmarks here for ex post regulation, the proposed AI Act (AIA) offers a first regulatory attempt towards an ex ante licensure regime in high-risk areas, but it should be strengthened through an expansion of its scope and substantive content and through greater transparency of the ex ante justification process. © 2023 The Author(s)","Accountability; AI; AIA; GDPR; Justification; Licensing; Regulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175873837"

As a widely acknowledged phrase among research institutions and universities, the ‘Industry 4.0’ paradigm has attracted significant interest from the academic, business and scientific communities. Even though the concept is not new and has been at the forefront of scholarly research for many years with many interpretations, the ‘Industry 4.0’ concept has just recently been introduced. It is widely accepted not only in the research field but also in the manufacturing ecosystems. However, there is a need to comprehend industry-specific research advancements, trends and gaps due to the diverse applications of different technologies. This article systematically reviews and comprehensively evaluates the research on different Industry 4.0 efforts and their applicability in the textile and manufacturing industries. This article aims to map the current Industry 4.0 literature in the textile and apparel industry to analyse and categorize existing research and identify research gaps. We utilized the PRISMA framework to conduct a systematic review of the literature and 34 research publications on Industry 4.0 in the textile and apparel industry were located using a well-organized keyword search of the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The findings indicate that, of all Industry 4.0 technologies, the internet of things (IoT) and RFID applications are the most extensively investigated in the textile and manufacturing industries. Despite the extensive applications of additive manufacturing (AM)/3D printing and augmented reality (AR), research in both fields is still in its infancy. The study revealed that Germany is the country that has published the most literature on Industry 4.0 projects in the textile and apparel industries. We urge that future academics focus on determining the relevance of Industry 4.0 initiatives to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as the textile and apparel industry is dominated by SMEs in many developing countries. © 2022 Management Development Institute.","Bibliometric Analysis; Industry 4.0; Textile and Apparel Industry; VOSviewer","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141615853"

The findings are in accordance with the framework of General Purpose Technologies that suggests that the impact of new technologies often appear with a lag. Moreover, no relationship is found for the total sample or for non-OECD countries.

The possibility and scale of DCBMAs will increase in countries with developed digital infrastructure, digital market, and digital technology. We extend a new distance dimension and find that digital distance may impede DCBMAs between two countries.

The paper shows that the value of advertising expenditures is an increasing function of economic policy uncertainty. The impact of advertising on firm performance is more pronounced during the periods characterized by higher economic policy uncertainty. We argue that, during uncertain times, the financial information loses its relevance. Therefore, during these periods, non-financial traits, such as brand image, customer equity, relationship capital, and familiarity that characterizes firms with high advertising become more important. The findings hold in various sub-samples and across various proxies of advertising activity. The findings also hold under alternate estimation procedures (pooled OLS regression, panel data with fixed effects and instrument variable regression). More importantly, this paper also shows that, relative to other agency reducing mechanisms (such as analyst coverage, asset utilization ratio, expense ratio and dividend payments), advertising is more valuable during periods with high economic policy uncertainty. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","advertising; emerging markets; firm performance; information asymmetry; marketing; World Uncertainty Index","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147362443"

This study aims to investigate the inventory-related optimization of an e-marketplace official store that works on a business-to-customer system when cashback promotion is used to attract more customers. Also, it proposes a new inventory model to maximize the e-commerce profit by optimizing the cashback amount and delivery period. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model assumes that customer demand is a function of price and delivery time and that price is affected by the cashback amount. The e-commerce operator has a profit-sharing contract with an e-payment company that facilitates the payment. E-commerce also builds collaboration under a cost-sharing contract with a supplier to ensure product delivery. A mathematical model is developed and the related theories are investigated. A numerical example illustrates the validity of the model and a sensitivity analysis is carried out to give useful insights. Findings: A new inventory model for an e-market system has been introduced which shows the impact of a cashback promotion on the e-commerce business. This study shows that managers can optimize the cashback amount and its delivery time to get the maximum profit. In certain cases, the manager may set a high cashback amount (e.g. 100%) to attract customers to place more orders. Originality/value: This study presents a new inventory model for today’s fast-growing e-commerce business; therefore, the results contribute to the understanding of promotion program practices and inventory management and provide insights to develop efficient e-commerce managerial decisions.

However, the current linear production model followed by most manufacturers is widely recognized as not being sustainable. The circular economy model can be an eco-friendly alternative to production and consumption, ensuring a smooth transition to sustainable practices. In this study, the impact of various sustainable practices in manufacturing is reviewed as well as the impact of life cycle assessment in the quantification of the impact of the sustainable practices. However, a simple and fast methodology for manufacturers to get a first indication about the potential improvements in their production lines and required changes for adopting circular economy practices is missing from the literature. The main objective of this study is to provide a quantified methodology that facilitates decision-making at a manufacturing process and system level regarding the adoption of more sustainable strategies. An eco-efficiency indicator is proposed targeting the reduction of energy consumption and manufacturing waste caused by production operations, on top of the life cycle assessment and cost analysis of a process. The indicator combines a process's environmental performance, whose calculation is performed using life cycle assessment studies, and the process's value performance, whose calculation is derived from a combination of a life cycle costing analysis with the process and product-related metrics encapsulated under the umbrella of the overall equipment effectiveness, and of a cost of implementation metrics signifying the required cost for replacing existing equipment to adopt a circular economy strategy. Additionally, the indicator is not constrained by any geographical coverage and applies to any manufacturing use case as long as the life cycle assessment model is constructed using the ISO 14044:2006 standard. The proposed approach is examined in two industrial use cases, in which the proposed indicator is evaluated against three potential circular economy strategies for improved sustainability, the use of renewable energy sources, and material reuse. © 2024 The Authors","Circular economy; Eco-efficiency; Life cycle assessment; Process; Sustainable manufacturing; Waste","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186270280"

We argue for an extension of this line of thinking with a reading of Latour’s notion tonalities. The relevance of the theoretical argument is demonstrated through an illustrative empirical example of the phenomenon digital-ready legislation. Findings: The paper identifies sequence as a root metaphor in the organization and digital change literature.

This exploratory research aims to establish a theoretical framework that elucidates the formation of sport fans' word-of-mouth (WOM) behaviours, particularly emphasising the structural relationship between motivated consumer innovativeness and satisfaction in using AR live-streaming services. Design/methodology/approach: Utilising an online survey and convenience sampling, the study garnered a total of 243 usable responses from three online baseball fan communities in South Korea. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to assess the psychometric properties of the constructs. Subsequently, a structural equation model was used to probe the influence of motivated consumer innovativeness on WOM, with a particular focus on the mediating role of satisfaction. Findings: Three dimensions of motivated sport fans innovativeness – functional, hedonic and cognitive – showed a positive association with WOM, partly mediated by satisfaction. In contrast, socially motivated sport fans innovativeness did not directly lead to WOM but influenced it solely through satisfaction. The full mediating role of satisfaction in the relationship between socially motivated fans innovativeness and WOM was found.

Specifically, the authors seek to explore whether and how the three critical characteristics of dynamic capabilities (DCs) – sensing, seizing and transforming capabilities – are linked to business model innovation (BMI) or sustained performance and what dimensions contribute to their development and adoption in digitalization strategies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyse a sample of 596 Vietnamese SMEs using a validated measurement framework to explore the three clusters of DCs activities and their contributions to digitalization strategies, BMI and sustainable business performance across economic, social and environmental dimensions. Findings: The study highlights the pivotal role of sensing, seizing and transforming capabilities in the adoption of digitalization strategies, BMI, as well as in promoting sustainable business performance. Firstly, sensing capability profoundly influences product digitalization strategy, whereas seizing capability has the greatest impact on process digitalization strategy. Secondly, sensing and transforming capabilities significantly contribute to BMI. Thirdly, both process and product digitalization strategies exert a significant positive influence on sustainable business performance, especially the environmental dimension. Finally, the study exhibits the indirect impacts of seizing and sensing capabilities on sustainable business performance through product and process digitization strategies. Originality/value: This study extends recent research by investigating the DCs underlying a firm’s digitalization strategies and contribute to ongoing calls for further investigation in the DCs literature. This research design, which draws from a validated measurement framework, responds to recent calls to broaden the toolkit used in DCs research. The practical implications of this study can benefit SMEs in Vietnam and beyond as they seek to enhance their digitalization strategies and achieve sustainable competitive advantage. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business model innovation; Digitalization; Dynamic capabilities; Sustainable business performance; Vietnam small- and medium-sized enterprises","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184399624"

Since 1998, the European Journal of Innovation Management (EJIM) has been a leading forum dedicated to thought leadership and research on the advances in innovation management. Given that EJIM has run over two decades, the time is now opportune to reflect on the journal's contributions to innovation management. Thus, this paper aims to retrospectively review the productivity, impact and knowledge of innovation management research in EJIM. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a bibliometric methodology to engage in a retrospective review of EJIM. The bibliographic data of 757 papers published in EJIM from 1998 to 2021 were retrieved from Scopus and analyzed using performance analysis and science mapping techniques. Findings: The productivity (publication) and impact (citation) of innovation management research curated by EJIM have grown prolifically over time. Though EJIM operates with a European title, the journal receives and publishes contributions worldwide (e.g. Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania). Noteworthily, the knowledge of innovation management research in EJIM can be divided into four categories: basic themes (general), which comprise innovation, open innovation, new product development and product and process innovation; motor themes (well-developed), which consist of organizational culture and innovation and leadership and creativity; niche themes (very specialized), which include dynamic capabilities and business model innovation; and emerging or declining themes (weakly developed or marginalized), which is made up of research and development (R&D) and green innovation.

The cash-back website returns a percentage of the paid price to the customer by sending a special link, created by this website based on the incentive policy. Although the extent of the impact of these websites on the sale rate, empirically or theoretically, is still uncertain, we know that this policy can have a positive impact on the online shopping and there are many customers who are sensitive to the price. The store’s website, in addition to the incentive policies, considers refund. Empirically, the refund policy provides a psychological comfort for customers. The use of incentive policies usually attracts more customers, but on the other hand, it reduces profits. The main purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the use of incentive policies and how these policies apply to the e-shop and other players in supply chain.

The sense of community in the peer-to-peer platform imbues consumers’ evaluation of their interactions with their peer-to-peer hosts with a different perspective based on communal norms. To directly test its moderating role, relationship norm is manipulated in Study 2, which shows that a communal relationship sensitizes the bystander to the unfair treatment that is considered a violation of the communal norms.

The results suggest several equifinal paths to corporate educational (mis)match. The findings reveal the need for a more hybridised coexistence between tertiary education and training activities, which can emerge from the cooperation of local actors (education/training institutions and businesses together). Tertiary education, training programmes focused on advanced IT skills, and collaborating with local knowledge providers can reinforce the effect; indeed, their presence (singly or in combination) intensifying the achievement of high levels of educational match. In the absence of these conditions (singly or in combination), a broad training programme can act as a counterbalance and vice versa. Policymakers should put in place tools to enable more inclusive access to collaborations between local businesses and knowledge providers, promoting an upgrade of educational programmes to develop shop-floor workers who are more digitally aware, and better prepared to successfully undertake non-routine cognitive tasks. This would foster the self-sustainability and flourishing of advanced manufacturing in high-income countries. © 2023 The Authors.

This article aims to identify key service- and digital technology-driven B2B innovation modes and proposes a research agenda for further exploration. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper adopts a techno-demarcation view on service innovation, encompassing three core dimensions: service offering (the service product, or the “what”), service process (the “how”) and service ecosystem (the “who/for whom”). It delineates the implications of three digital technologies – the internet-of-things (IoT), intelligent automation (IA) and digital platforms – for service innovation across these core dimensions in B2B markets. Findings: Digital technology has immense potential ramifications for value creation by reshaping all three core dimensions of service innovation. Specifically, IoT can transform physical resources into reconfigurable service products, IA can augment and automate a rapidly expanding array of service processes, while digital platforms provide the technical and organizational infrastructure for the integration of resources and stakeholders within service ecosystems.

This change is greatest in developing countries where 5G network deployment is scarce and key to their economy. This article aims to analyze the strategic design of a business model to provide 5G network equipment installation services in Peru. In addition, the article includes the design of a business structure for the implementation of the business model, as well as the evaluation of economic and financial projections to determine the economic viability of its implementation. The methodological approach covers business management applied to business design, examining several key areas such as business management, human resource management, finance, accounting, marketing, and operations management. The study of the business model is based on business management theory, using accounting and finance concepts to analyze the most significant financial indicators. The information and data used to analyze the aspects of the business model are extracted from the databases of Peruvian institutions. Our results reveal that implementing a business model for providing 5G network equipment installation services in Peru is economically viable since the economic and financial projections show that a Net Present Value of 146,931.02 monetary units is obtained.

We then obtain the optimal strategies of firms and evaluate the impact of contamination events on the dynamic operations of the supply chain. The results show increased contamination likelihood and damage rate, which harm the goodwill of food and optimal decision-making.

Thus, predicated on a novel strategy creation perspective, this inquiry aims to investigate the crisis behaviour, sales and cash flow performance of 528 SMEs in Morocco. Design/methodology/approach: Novel links between (1) aggregate wage cuts, (2) variable operating hours, (3) deferred payment to suppliers, (4) deferred payment to tax authorities and (5) sales performance are developed and tested. A further link between sales performance and cash flow is also examined and the analysis is conducted using a non-linear structural equation modelling technique. Findings: While there is a significant association between strategy creation behaviours and sales performance, only variable operating hours have a positive effect. Also, sales performance increases cash flow and this relationship is substantially strengthened by e-commerce digitalization and innovation. Originality/value: Theoretically, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first inquiries to espouse the strategy creation view to explain SMEs' crisis-time behaviour and digitalization. For practical purposes, to supplement Moroccan SMEs' propensity to seek tax deferrals, it is argued that debt and equity support measures are also needed to boost sales performance and cash flow. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cash flow; Crisis-time behaviour; Digitalization; Morocco; Sales performance; Strategy creation view","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174233061"

The importance of this paper is to investigate the relationship between hydroelectricity and the Human Development Index by depending on some variables such as urbanization, rule of law, corruption, trade openness, and GDP per capita from 2002 to 2021 in Nordic countries. The results were estimated depending on impulse response function after conducting the Vector autoregressive model (VAR) model and Granger causality test. Results showed a negative impact from hydro plants in the short run but a significant positive impact in the long run in Nordic countries.

This literature review leads to the development of a DT framework to help cities conduct a planned and federated DT beforehand. Then, workshops are conducted with two major Canadian municipalities. Findings: The results of these studies point to the need for a dedicated DT framework for municipalities because of their particular context and their role and proximity to citizens. The theoretical framework develops 22 elements, which are divided among 6 categories.

The emphasis is on the identification of annual growth of publications, country-wise distribution, publication pattern, intellectual structure and cluster analysis of scientific production in this field. Design/methodology/approach: This study used evaluative techniques, text mining approach and performance analysis to identify possible patterns and correlation and to measure the impact of authors/citations/scientific production. Further, this study used the bibliometric mapping to represent the structural features of scientific production. This study emphasized on identification of the research hotspots based on occurrence of indexed keywords, productive researchers and journals during 2000–2022. Further, cluster analysis is performed using VOS viewer to analyze the current dynamics and future direction of the association between trade openness and economic growth (Eck and Waltman, 2011). Also, co-citation analysis is used in this study to identify the relations among authors or journals or documents using citation data, whereas the bibliographic coupling/mapping is intended to analyze the citing documents. Similarly, co-word analysis is used to study the article keywords that are mainly used to assess the conceptual structure of a concerning subject. Findings: Economic growth is a function of trade openness, and it is important to analyze the relationship between trade openness and economic growth. Trade openness tends to become more liberalized over time, to contribute more to economic growth. Empirical evidence suggested that there exists a strong association between trade openness and economic growth. Further, keyword timeline analysis illustrated that the linkage between trade openness and economic growth is current area of interest among researchers. As per bibliometric analysis, China, Pakistan and Malaysia are the three most prolific countries in the terms of published articles on this theme. However, the most influential publications based on h-index and citation on trade openness–economic growth relationship is produced by Turkey. Based on cluster analysis, this study suggests that researchers are currently working on trade openness–economic growth relationship with other variables such as FDI, financial development, labor force, environment degradation and carbon emission, while in future, researchers could work on variables such as technology and sustainable development. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations of this study. The first limitation is the authors have used Scopus database, leaving the possibility for future research to use Web of Science, Google Scholar or other similar sources. The second limitation is that the authors have used search terms “trade openness “and “economic growth,” although research could be performed using synonyms or even relevant terms in other languages. Practical implications: Cluster analysis suggested that researchers are currently working on trade openness–economic growth relationship with other variables such as FDI, financial development, labor force, environment degradation and carbon emission, while in future, researchers could work on variables such as technology and sustainable development.

In the higher education sector, in which education, research, and knowledge dissemination hold paramount significance for society, the notion of digital transformation per se becomes particularly important. This paper focuses specifically on higher education, acknowledging that it exists in a broader environment. In this work, qualitative methods were applied to explore the meaning and scope of digital transformation in higher education institutions. The systematic literature review formed the basis for in-depth interviews with experts in the discipline to explore the meaning and scope of digital transformation in higher education institutions. Then, for the purpose of preparing the case study, the concepts that emerged from the systematic literature review and interviews with experts were grouped together through a keyword-based pattern. Lastly, a case study was conducted at a Greek university with the aim of better understanding the way in which university members of a particular higher education institution perceive the meaning and scope of digital transformation. Our analysis provides valuable insights into higher education institutions for decision-makers and those involved in digital transformation initiatives, offering a comprehensive definition of digital transformation in higher education institutions. Finally, this paper can also serve as a basis for researchers who are interested in defining the meaning and scope of digital transformation in their own research fields. © 2024 by the authors.","digital transformation; higher education; university","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188808431"

However, certain obstacles, such as site selection, hinder solar energy development in this region. Therefore, major energy stakeholders must identify optimal solar photovoltaic construction locations. The present study endeavored to conduct a comprehensive and meticulous review of pertinent literature published from 2013 to 2023 to identify critical factors that influence site selection and look into various methodologies employed in this domain. Later, a two-stage approach was used for the first time to identify the most suitable locations among 39 potential cities in the Baltic region for constructing solar PV farms. In the first stage, Data envelopment analysis (DEA) models were used to filter out the areas with the highest potential by measuring their efficiency indices using temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, and air pressure as inputs and sunshine hours, elevation, and irradiation as outputs. Subsequently, six selected evaluation criteria were used to prioritize the locations with solar energy potential. In the second stage, CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC)-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to determine the criteria's objective weights and rank potential sites for the research case study. The results indicate that 25 locations in the Baltic region are suitable for building solar farms, with specific photovoltaic power output being the most significant criterion that impacts solar site selection. Furthermore, by excluding Gross domestic product (GDP) and labor force from the analysis, the results can align with the Global Solar Atlas's reports. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Location selection; Photovoltaic; Site selection; Solar energy; Solar plant","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186271194"

Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of Midjourney, one such AI system, in both fashion design and related commerce applications. We employed the action research approach with the Functional, Expressive, and Aesthetic (FEA) Consumer Needs Model as the theoretical framework. Our research comprised three stages: refining an initial idea into well-defined textual design concepts, facilitating concept development, and validating the preceding observations and reflections by creating a new line of hemp-based products that were evaluated by targeted consumers through an online survey. Findings reveal that this AI tool can assist fashion designers in creating both visually expressive attire and ready-to-wear products, meeting defined design criteria and consumer needs. Midjourney shows promise in streamlining the fashion design process by enhancing ideation and optimizing design details. Potential e-commercial applications of such AI systems were proposed, benefiting physical and digital fashion businesses. It is noted that, to date, the major limitations of using Midjourney encompass its restriction to only facilitating early fashion design stages and necessitating substantial involvement from designers. © 2024 by the authors.","action research; AI text-to-image generator; artificial intelligence; diffusion modeling; fashion design; Functional, Expressive, and Aesthetic (FEA) Consumer Needs Model; Midjourney","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188902466"

To effectively anticipate future trends, businesses need to analyze large amounts of data, use sophisticated analytical techniques, and stay up-to-date with the latest research and industry trends. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to identify trends in consumer behavior using multiple layers of processing, including clustering, classification, and association rule learning. The aim is to help a major retailer in Saudi Arabia better understand customer behavior by utilizing the power of big data analysis. The proposed framework is presented as being generalized to gain insight into the generated big data and enable data-driven decision-making in other relevant domains. We developed this framework in collaboration with a large supermarket chain in Saudi Arabia, which provided us with over 1,000,000 sales transaction records belonging to around 30,000 of their loyal customers. In this study, we apply our proposed framework to those data as a case study and present our initial results of consumer clustering and association rules for each cluster.

Testing can now be set and delivered within seconds, making optimisations faster than ever. However, traditional models, such as A/B testing and multi-variate testing, face challenges as marketing professionals seek to expand experimentation to areas where controlled conditions cannot be met. Among these is the case of search engine optimisation (SEO) experimentation, an area that is steadily becoming a crucial element in modern marketing strategies. This paper explores the use of quasi-experimental designs to overcome these challenges, allowing for the collection of insights when traditional experimental setups are unfeasible. Examples are provided to show how quasi-experiments can be effectively applied in multiple SEO scenarios, assessing the performance of the treated pages and using correlation to generate comparable control groups. It advocates for a shift in the mindset of digital marketing professionals, stressing the importance of adaptability in experimental approaches, underscoring the necessity to embrace quasi-experimental designs in modern marketing strategies by highlighting their pivotal role in achieving data-driven insights in an increasingly complex digital world. © Henry Stewart Publications 2054-7544 (2024).","data-driven insights; digital marketing; marketing experimentation; marketing strategies; quasi-experimental design; search engine algorithms; SEO testing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188329315"

While previous studies have expounded upon how platform sides can be coordinated at a collective level (i.e., by pricing strategy and modular architecture), digital platform owners must not neglect the dynamics within the platform sides and their interactions. Through an in-depth case study of one of the largest e-commerce platforms worldwide, we develop a process model that explains digital platform coordination in terms of the mechanisms that describe the emergence of coordination issues as a result of the enactment of the platform sides’ agency and how these issues can be circumvented. This study makes two contributions. First, this study challenges the existing DP literature concerning the assumption of exogenous platform sides, highlighting the agency of the sides as a source of misalignment that must be managed. Second, the model complements the platform coordination literature focusing on enabling/constraining the actions of sides by conceptualizing a digital orienting mechanism.

The proposed relationship was explored specifically for millennials. Design/methodology/approach: The questionnaire was divided into three segments to assess millennials' financial literacy, risk tolerance and risky investment intention. This study uses survey data from 402 millennial investors residing in Delhi-NCR region. The authors exploited PLS-SEM for the analysis because the model involved higher-order constructs. Findings: The findings revealed that financial literacy has a negative impact on risky investment intention. Further, risk tolerance had a positive and significant influence on risky investment intention; however, when financial literacy was added as a moderating variable in this relationship, it had a negative impact on risky investment intention. Originality/value: Every generation has its quirks, and millennials are no exception. Given their age and sheer number, leading to their dominance in the global workforce, millennials will bring about a generational shift. Awareness of Gen Y's financial literacy and risk behavior enhances their ability to make informed financial decisions, thus proving beneficial not only to them, but also to the whole economy.

On the other hand, emergence of new technologies, such as the blockchain technology, has made a significant impact in the way businesses interact with each other. The blockchain technology offers several advantages, including enhanced information security, transparency, traceability, decentralization, and enabling the use of smart and trustless contracts, among others. While previous research has studied blockchain technology in supply chain management, its application towards advancing SSS remains unexplored. This study fills this gap by specifically addressing the blockchain technology adoption into the sustainable supplier selection and order allocation process. In doing so, a novel two-phase framework is proposed to deal with the problem under consideration. In phase I, first, the Best Worst Method (BWM) is used for calculating the importance weights of criteria for supplier selection in four categories of economic, circular, social, and blockchain compatibility to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of suppliers. Next, the MULTIMOORA method is applied to derive the scores of suppliers, where a new scoring method, addressing the shortcomings of the dominance theory approach, is proposed in the MULTIMOORA method in this paper. Then, the phase II of the framework determines the final selected suppliers and the optimal allocation of orders to each selected supplier through a bi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. The developed model incorporates a novel cost objective, which includes information coordination and oracle-related costs corresponding to blockchain infrastructure deployment, and also a blockchain-related threshold constraint to ensure that the buyer does not exceed its predefined limits towards blockchain attunement. The proposed approach in this paper represents a significant contribution to the field of supplier selection by integrating sustainability and blockchain-related attributes into the decision-making process. The numerical results demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of the proposed approach in identifying blockchain-enabled and sustainable suppliers, making it a valuable decision-making tool for businesses seeking to enhance their procurement processes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; BWM method; Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP); MULTIMOORA; Order allocation; Sustainable supplier selection (SSS)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185395104"

This initiative aims to usher consumers towards more environmentally-conscious purchasing decisions by providing insights into the ecological impact of their food choices. Our comprehensive research explores a variety of determinants that sway Taiwanese consumers in their buying behaviors, specifically focusing on the influence of these carbon footprint labels. Surprisingly, while one might anticipate media exposure to be a dominant force in shaping opinions, our findings suggest its role remains relatively limited in this context. Instead, personal experiences with climate events and robust influences from family and peers emerge as the primary drivers in purchasing decisions. These direct interpersonal interactions, both in terms of shared experiences and word-of-mouth recommendations, offer profound insights into shaping consumer behavior. As Taiwan ambitiously targets net-zero emissions by 2050, harnessing the power of these social dynamics becomes imperative.

However, the expansion of agricultural activities poses a threat to this potential. Notably, eucalyptus forests could enhance carbon sequestration and reduce GHG emissions. This study focused on Três Lagoas, known as Brazil's cellulose capital, and aimed to evaluate carbon stock and sequestration for 2030 under business as usual (BAU) and protected forest (PF) scenarios. Combining Cellular Automata (CA) and Random Forest models implemented in Patch-Generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, we simulated land use scenarios and assessed ecosystem services generated by carbon sequestration. The results showed that the PF scenario indicated a higher total carbon stock than the BAU scenario, with a difference of 2.48 Tg. Carbon sequestration varied by period and scenario. Between 2010 and 2020, 3.88 Tg of carbon were sequestered. However, in the next period (2020–2030), the BAU scenario estimated 2.45 Tg in total carbon sequestration. In contrast, the PF scenario predicted 4.93 Tg of carbon sequestration for 2020–2030, surpassing the previous decade. Monetarily, carbon sequestration in 2010–2020 amounted to $92.48 million, decreasing to $58.49 million for 2020–2030 in the BAU scenario. In the PF scenario, sequestration for 2020–2030 increased to $ 117.43 million, nearly double that of the BAU scenario. In conclusion, combining the Ca-Markov/Random Forest and InVEST models revealed the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon stock and sequestration in the municipality with the largest eucalyptus-planted area in Brazil. The results underscore the significant variability in carbon stocks and sequestration based on classes, periods, and scenarios analyzed. This study contributes valuable insights into the potential for carbon mitigation in this critical region. © 2024","Ecosystem services; Forestry; LULC prediction; Trade-offs; Três lagoas","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185407575"

However, user growth does not necessarily imply strong user stickiness. Without user stickiness, strong network effects in the current period may fade in future periods, thus rendering a user growth strategy ineffective. By adding a time dimension to network effects, we developed a model of cross-period and within-period network effects to explain how different types of network effects drive value. We emphasize that the cross-period same-side network effect contributes to user stickiness, while the within-period cross-side network effect persists conditional on user stickiness. We propose that one reason for platforms having heterogeneous cross-period same-side network effects is because of the “product learning” mechanism: it is expected that products with higher uncertainty have a stronger cross-period same-side network effect. Based on different drivers, we extend the customer lifetime value model (CLV2) to two-sided platform markets, allowing us to measure how different interventions drive platform value. Using Groupon data, we verify our insights and discuss platform design choices that enhance user stickiness when the cross-period same-side network effect is weak. © 2024.

CSR is related to corporate risk management, as by engaging in CSR activities firms can be more effective in managing stakeholder relationships. Extant studies rarely examine both issues to the level of digital transformation. In the coming years, the issue of digital transformation will have an even bigger impact on business models. The first step in the effective implementation of ERM is the ability of the organization to learn and understand the requirements of ERM implementation in its company. Thus, it is important to examine the effect of the maturity learn element in ERM and CSR as risk management on the level of digital transformation. In addition, this paper also examines the moderating role of CSR on the association between ERM and the level of digital transformation.

By integrating the IoT with the transportation industry, there will be dramatic changes in the industry, and it will provide many entrepreneurial opportunities for entrepreneurs to develop new businesses. Opportunity identification is at the heart of the entrepreneurial process, and entrepreneurs identify innovative goods or services to enter a new market by identifying, evaluating, and exploiting opportunities. Despite the desire of transportation managers to invest in the IoT and the increase in research in this area, limited research has focused on IoT-based entrepreneurial opportunities in the transportation industry. Therefore, the present study aims to identify IoT-based entrepreneurial opportunities in the transportation industry and examine their importance. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research objective, the authors applied a mixed approach. First, adapting the lens of the industry value chain theory, a comprehensive literature review, besides a qualitative approach including semi-structured interviews with experts and thematic analysis, was conducted to identify the entrepreneurial opportunities. The identified opportunities were confirmed in the second stage using a quantitative survey method, including the Student t-test and factor analysis. Finally, the identified opportunities were weighted and ranked using the best worst method (BWM). Findings: Entrepreneurial opportunities are classified into five main categories, including “smart vehicles”, “business partners/smart transportation supply side”, “supporting services”, “infrastructures”, and “smart transport management and control”. The infrastructures group of opportunities ranked the highest amongst the identified groups. Originality/value: This study adds to the digital entrepreneurship opportunity recognition literature by addressing opportunities in a smart industry propelled by digital technologies, including developing new products or new applications of the available technologies. Additionally, inspired by the industry value chain theory, this article develops a framework including various digital entrepreneurial opportunity networks which are necessary to add value to any industry and, thus, could be applied by entrepreneurs to recognize opportunities for new intermediaries to enter other digital-based industries. Finally, the present study identifies the IoT-based entrepreneurial opportunities in the smart transportation industry and prioritizes them, providing practical insights regarding the creation of entrepreneurial ecosystems in the field of smart transportation for entrepreneurs and policymakers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Best worst method (BWM); Entrepreneurial opportunities; Entrepreneurship; Internet of things (IoT); Transportation industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165909513"

The analysis was developed through three different regressions involving the long period 1995–2020 and the short period 2017–2020. The results show how increasing carbon emissions and environmental taxes positively impact stock indices. The former is linked to an increase in production and, therefore, economic growth, and the latter encourages sustainability. Taxes on transport and energy in the long term generate higher costs, which damage profitability and negatively impact the performance of stock indices. Finally, in the short term, implementing environmental protection measures or the sustainable management of resources may lead to higher operating costs for the companies involved. These cost increases can negatively impact profit margins and reduce the value of companies. These results, therefore, show us how environmental sustainability has a significant impact on European stock markets; consequently, the relevant regulations and policies should also consider the economic and managerial impacts that companies implement to achieve their objectives of the Green Deal. © 2024 by the authors.","carbon emissions; CEPA; DESI; digitalization; environment; Europe; index price; renewable energy; research and development; stock market index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188838066"

Through the perspective of entrepreneurial marketing, this study aims to explore the influence of e-commerce technologies on the decision-making process of entrepreneurial marketing. This exploration is conducted via a case study of pure-play e-retailers based in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilised a qualitative case study methodology to examine the complex processes of entrepreneurial marketing in an online environment. The study gathered detailed insights from both owner-managers and staff members of eight pure-play e-retail businesses. Additionally, the research involved a careful review of the firms' webpages and social media pages. This holistic approach facilitated a comprehensive understanding of their marketing strategies and practices. Findings: The case study findings indicate that while many core aspects of entrepreneurial marketing remain important, there are distinct factors influencing the entrepreneurial marketing decision-making in the online marketplace. The online EM framework can be visualised as follows: (1) trend-orientated as well as innovative-orientated (2) data-orientated and entrepreneur-orientated (3) innovative-driven customer stimulation (4) orientated towards both platforms and proactiveness. Originality/value: The paper provides an initial understanding of how digitalisation is enabling and transforming entrepreneurship in companies with high level digitalisation but low level digital development. Building on current entrepreneurial marketing literature, this paper develops an online entrepreneurial marketing framework to enhance understanding of the interaction between e-commerce technology and entrepreneurial marketing decision making. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital entrepreneurship; E-commerce; Entrepreneurial decision-making; Entrepreneurial marketing; SME online marketing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167914871"

However, the influence of developing these capabilities on business value has not been explored in the realm of institutional governance—the regulatory context that defines the rules of the game for firms. We suggest that the value of a firm’s investments in different types of IT capabilities development (ITCD) is evaluated by the financial market contingent on the firm’s regulatory context. Our study is situated in the U.S. electric utility industry undergoing a market restructuring process to understand the impacts of intrafirm and interfirm ITCD on market value conditional on a firm’s regulatory context characterized by the extent to which its business is located in states that allow consumer choice (i.e., deregulation), as well as the extent to which its business is located in states that deliberate regulations regarding price control, value chain configuration, and information control (i.e., regulatory uncertainty). We find that intrafirm ITCD for enhancing efficiency is rewarded in a firm’s market valuation under a high level of deregulation. We further find that under a high level of regulatory uncertainty, interfirm ITCD for fostering flexibility can hedge against regulatory uncertainty and increase firm value. A key contribution of our work is demonstrating external institutional governance can influence the market value that firms accrue from different types of ITCD, thereby elaborating the complementarity in theoretical explanations of IT capabilities and institutional governance. © 2024 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

This paper investigates the strategies for adopting recommender systems by online retailers, introducing a theoretical model to assess whether both incumbent and new entrant retailers should adopt these systems. The model conducts a comparative analysis, factoring in consumers’ search costs and the strategic choices of competitors. It establishes equilibrium outcomes for four distinct scenarios, followed by an analysis of the interplay between the strategy selection decisions of the two types of retailers. The results show that if one retailer does not adopt the system, the other retailer should always adopt it. However, when one retailer has already implemented the system, the other retailer should only do so if the search cost is relatively low and the recommendation cost is high, but not when the search cost is moderate. Given two retailers’ strategies, we identify the requirements that form two equilibriums: both retailers adopting the system, or only the incumbent retailer adopting it. Furthermore, the recommendation levels and product prices are not necessarily in a monotonic relationship with the cost of the system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer search; Game theory; Online retailing; Recommender system; Retailer competition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186755283"

Sustainability is characterized by supporting the building of resilient infrastructure and promoting the sustainable industry. In this context, sustainable transport is particularly important as it represents an opportunity for regional development. This research aims to quantify the impact of investments through structural instruments, specifically EU funds, on promoting a sustainable transport system and eliminating barriers from large-scale transport networks. This study focuses on the impact of these investments on regional economic development in Romania. The analysis used data from all eight development regions of the Romanian economy between 2014 and 2020. Panel data regression models, including the generalized difference method of moments (Dif-GMM) and the system GMM method (Sys GMM), were employed. This study confirms the idea that European structural and investment funds (ESIFs) play a positive role in promoting sustainable transport for regional economic development. Additionally, the quality of regional governance is identified as a key factor in economic development. This study, therefore, reveals a convergence effect between regions. Regions with a lower initial GDP per capita develop quicker compared to regions with a higher initial GDP per capita, indicating a “catch-up” effect.

The purpose of this study is to shed light in a neglected niche in the intersection between digital entrepreneurship (DE) and entrepreneurship education and outline DE education as field of research. Given that the interdisciplinary growth of DE research outpaces instructional designs in terms of required knowledge and skills, it is important to document how entrepreneurship education responds to the ongoing integration of emerging digital technologies with the entrepreneurial process. Moreover, the introduction of a DE education conceptual framework would facilitate the discussion on theoretical and practical implications and promote new conceptualizations in future research, new educational approaches and new curriculum designs. Design/methodology/approach: A concept-driven, semi-structured developmental literature review methodology, based on grounded theory and reinforced with increased systemization, was used for the identification and analysis of peer-reviewed articles. Previous literature reviews were used to define the search keywords. The articles from three databases were carefully selected, based on protocol and strict eligibility criteria. The papers in the final set were classified in four primary dimensions, synthesized from several sub-streams of research. Each sub-stream highlighting a different view of DE education emerged through open, axial and selective coding of articles. The combined perspectives of these dimensions resulted in a new DE conceptual framework. Findings: Thematic interrelation between the studies examined, revealed an ample view of the various schools of thought in the research field, offering also a better understanding on how entrepreneurial education addresses the practical requirements of digital entrepreneurship. A four dimensional conceptual framework produced highlights pedagogy and learning, success factors and barriers, behavioral approach and ecosystems as the current trends of research. Also, directions for future research are proposed. Practical implications: The classification framework proposed can serve as a roadmap for entrepreneurship educators seeking efficient pedagogical practices focused on the transfer of knowledge and training on the new skills required by DE and motivate future researchers aiming to propose novel educational interventions. Originality/value: Although digital entrepreneurship research has gained significant momentum in recent years, little attention is paid to its increased educational requirements. The body of knowledge develops in an uncontrolled and fragmented manner, and the systematic study of the field from an educational perspective was missing. This study offers a representative picture of the topic, highlights current trends of research, synthesizes literature from different disciplinary origins, provides linkages between unconnected streams of research and points out research gaps. Finally, it proposes a conceptual framework to circumscribe DE education as a field of study and serve as a basis to help future research move forward. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship course; Entrepreneurship education; Literature review","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173037236"

Economic sustainability is the key to further development and progress. To keep up with the changes, it is necessary to adapt economic models and concepts to meet the requirements of future smart environments. Today, the need for electronic commerce (e-commerce) has become an economic priority during the transition between Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Unlike mass production in Industry 4.0, customized production in Industry 5.0 should gain additional benefits in vertical management and decision-making concepts. The authors’ research is focused on e-commerce in a three-layer vertical IoT environment. The vertical IoT concept is composed of edge, fog, and cloud layers. Given the ubiquity of artificial intelligence in data processing, economic analysis, and predictions, this paper presents a few state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms facilitating the transition from a flat to a vertical e-commerce concept. The authors also propose hands-on ML algorithms for a few e-commerce types: consumer–consumer and consumer–company–consumer relationships. These algorithms are mainly composed of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), natural language understanding (NLU), sequential pattern mining (SPM), reinforcement learning (RL for agent training), algorithms for clicking on the item prediction, consumer behavior learning, etc. All presented concepts, algorithms, and models are described in detail. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); electronic commerce (e-commerce); fuzzy logic; Industry 4.0; Industry 5.0; Internet of Things (IoT); machine learning (ML)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188920487"

Data-opolies, typically embodied by large technology corporations, accumulate extensive datasets, affording them significant influence. The sustainability of such data practices is critically examined within the context of decentralized Web3 technologies amidst Artificial Intelligence (AI) disruption. Additionally, the article explores emancipatory datafication strategies to counterbalance the dominance of data-opolies. It presents an in-depth analysis of two emergent phenomena within the decentralized Web3 emerging landscape: People-Centered Smart Cities and Datafied Network States. The article investigates a paradigm shift in data governance and advocates for joint efforts to establish equitable data ecosystems, with an emphasis on prioritizing data sovereignty and achieving digital self-governance. It elucidates the remarkable roles of (i) blockchain, (ii) decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and (iii) data cooperatives in empowering citizens to have control over their personal data. In conclusion, the article introduces a forward-looking examination of Web3 decentralized technologies, outlining a timely path toward a more transparent, inclusive, and emancipatory data-driven democracy.

Although this can provide valuable between-person, point-in-time insights (e.g., employees who use neutralization techniques, such as denying responsibility for cybersecurity policy violations, tend to comply less), it is unable to reveal within-person patterns that account for varying experiences and situations over time. This paper articulates why an idiographic approach, which undertakes a within-person analysis of longitudinal data, can: (1) help validate widely used theories in behavioral cybersecurity research that imply patterns of behavior within a given person over time and (2) provide distinct theoretical insights on behavioral cybersecurity phenomena by accounting for such within-person patterns. To these ends, we apply an idiographic approach to an established theory in behavioral cybersecurity research—neutralization theory—and empirically test a within-person variant of this theory using a four-week experience sampling study. Our results support a more granular application of neutralization theory in the cybersecurity context that considers the behavior of a given person over time. We conclude the paper by highlighting the contexts and theories that provide the most promising opportunities for future behavioral cybersecurity research using an idiographic approach. © 2024.

To date, the impacts of these two challenges on firms have largely been examined as separate issues. However there are suggestions of overlap, with the potential of digital technologies to help economies and firms shift to greener production methods. This paper provides a novel contribution to this literature on a “twin transition” by examining for the first time the overlap at a firm level between climate actions and digitalisation. The data are drawn from a large-scale survey of 3,000 firms in Ireland in 2020. The report includes novel questions on energy use, climate adaption priorities and digital strategies along with a wide range of firm characteristics. Our key outcome variables are the degree of digitalisation in the firm, if it has a climate plan and does it implement climate actions such as monitoring emissions. We find considerable overlap between having a climate and a digital plan in place across firms, while controlling for a range of other firm characteristics. At the same time, we find a reasonably large share of firms have positive attitudes to the importance of climate planning but without reporting corresponding concrete actions, suggesting a gap for policy to address. © 2024, Economic and Social Studies.

One possible strategy to address these challenges for smoothing the supply chain (SC) and logistics operations is to adopt Industry 4.0 (I4.0) based technologies in the FMCG business processes. In this regard, digitalization and automation of the FMCG supply chain can be strengthened by the alluring properties of I4.0 technologies. Methods: This study identified nine significant challenges through a literature review and expert validation. Later, the challenges were evaluated using a novel multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) framework, the Bayesian best worst method (BWM). Results: The findings indicated that “requirement for substantial investment and resources”, “incompatible technological infrastructure” and “poorly structured value chain” are the most significant challenges to implementing I4.0 in the FMCG industry. Conclusions: The study is expected to significantly contribute to improving the FMCG supply chain’s resilience, sustainability, visibility, traceability and responsiveness. Additionally, the research can provide industrial practitioners valuable insights into implementing I4.0 in FMCG and similar sectors and thus promote SC sustainability and resilience in those industries. © 2024 by the authors.","Bayesian best worst method (BWM); FMCG business; Industry 4.0; multicriteria decision-making (MCDM); supply chain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188887966"

Multiple impediments make managing this transformation using digital technologies difficult for firms, their customers and wider ecosystems. Extant knowledge of these digital technology impediments requires synthesizing and mapping. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted. DSI tools and terminology are synthesized via thematic analysis. Subsequently, impediments to DSI for servitization (covering barriers, challenges and tensions) faced by actors across three key innovation phases: strategic planning, design planning and implementation, and four interaction levels (Micro, Meso, Macro-environment, Macro-ecosystem) are mapped via template analysis. Findings: Six impediment categories (external environmental factors, internal firm factors, capabilities, business models and processes, value creation and interaction) encompassing 28 unique impediment types to DSI during servitization are identified. A framework enabling impediment comparison across innovation phases and ecosystem/network interaction levels, revealing that the majority of barriers can be framed as “challenges” was developed. Originality/value: Whilst literature is emerging relating to digital servitization, there is a lack of research on the role DSI plays in facilitating digital servitization and no comprehensive study of DSI impediments exists. Additionally, consensus around the cross-disciplinary terminologies used is lacking. This study is a structured attempt to map the domain, summarizing the terms, identifying and clarifying impediment categories and providing recommendations for researchers and managers in tackling the latter. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Barriers; Challenges; Digital; Digitalization; Ecosystems; Impediments; Interactions; Service innovation; Servitization; SLR; Tensions","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174151477"

However, many micro-, small- and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Malaysia are still considered conventional businesses; therefore, it is necessary to transform them into sustainable enterprises. The initial step is to build up their intention towards SE. However, studies pertaining to SE intention are still considered low. Therefore, this study examined the influence of institutional factors on SE intention among Malaysian MSMEs. The institutional model was employed in identifying the influencing factors, namely governmental actions, social norms, and time orientation. A quantitative research method was employed. The sample was selected using proportionate stratified sampling. A total of 342 owner-managers of manufacturing MSMEs were surveyed using an online self-administered questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed through partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results revealed that governmental actions, social norms, and time orientation were significant in influencing SE intention positively. It could be concluded that components in the institutional model should not be neglected in fostering SE intention. This study shed light on the applicability of institutional theory in studying SE intention and pointed out the crucial factors that should be taken into consideration when encouraging MSMEs to embark on SE. © 2024 Sciendo.

However, because this pressure does not necessarily drive the adoption of supply chain social sustainability (SCSS) at the suppliers' end, further investigation is imperative. Additionally, despite the increased academic attention to the supplier base concerning SCSS, small suppliers' perspectives have been insufficiently examined. The objectives of the current study are to explore the positive and negative influences of various small suppliers' stakeholders on SCSS adoption, small suppliers' perceptions regarding stakeholders' demands, and the mechanisms they employ in response to these influences. An exploratory qualitative approach involving semi-structured interviews is used to collect primary data from owners and managers of 28 companies in the Indian manufacturing sector. The findings reveal that positive and negative influences and pressures to espouse SCSS emerge from two categories of stakeholders: primary and secondary. Small suppliers perceive different stakeholders' SCSS expectations as complementary, contrasting, and not-so-essential, and they adopt three mechanisms to manage stakeholders' demands: compliance, trade-off, and avoidance. This study adds new insights to the existing SCSS literature by offering under-represented small suppliers' viewpoints and developing a conceptual model using stakeholder theory. It also provides some practical implications for various stakeholders, including owners of small enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","India; Manufacturing; Small suppliers; Stakeholder influence; Supply chain social sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185530375"

The study, focusing on fifteen commercial banks, employs seven regression models to assess the impact of selected variables on bank operating efficiency. Our findings reveal novel insights with substantial contributions to banking practice. We identify a statistically significant influence of both bank-specific factors and temporal effects, demonstrating the nuanced dynamics shaping the operational efficiency of Jordanian banks. Notably, a positive and significant correlation is established between the operating efficiency ratio and return on assets, bank size, and the ratio of loan loss provisions to net interest income, providing valuable strategic guidance for effective management. Conversely, a significant negative relationship is observed between the operating efficiency ratio and the total expense ratio, underscoring the critical importance of careful cost management. No significant associations are found between the operating efficiency ratio and credit risk, the equity-to-asset ratio, the deposit-to-liability ratio, and the equity-to-liability ratio. This study makes a unique contribution by shedding light on these previously unexplored correlations, offering actionable insights for enhancing operational efficiency in the banking sector. Additionally, our research advocates for the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) to persist in adaptive policy measures, which are crucial for ongoing banking reforms and improved monitoring practices.

This study is premised on two simple explanations that cascaded into two hypothetical questions: (i) Are there inspiring factors for individuals to start up their own agri-preneurship business? (ii) Are there factors hindering individuals from starting up their own agri-preneurship business? These two hypothetical constructs triggered four primary arguments established in the study. This study was conducted in Mbombela local Municipality in category ‘B’, which is made up of the Ehlanzeni District, Mpumalanga South Africa. From a population of 1021 farmers, 458 samples of respondents were obtained and considered to be realistic for the study. The study embraced the mixed research approach, and the field survey was done between the months of February 2022 and June 2022. Descriptive statistics, involving the frequency count and percentages, were used to determine the motives and obstacles of starting up one’s own business. The hypothesis was assessed by employing multinominal logistic regression to determine the relationship between demographic variables and predictor variables. The findings revealed that potential agri-preneurs are affected by an array of inspiring factors in the decision-making process. Further, the results revealed that agri-preneurial spirit is inhibited by numerous challenges. In the shared view of respondents, there was a portmanteau of obstacles impeding the commencement of one’s own business. The results also showed that, in the self-realization variant, age (p < 0.035) and marital status (p < 0.033) were found to be correlated and statistically significant as an inspiration for setting up an agri-preneurship business, while the self-satisfaction variant specified marital status (p < 0.001) to be significant and to negatively (β −1.564) influence inspiration for agri-preneurship. In the independence variant category, two crucial variables, level of formal education (p < 0.005) and farm experience (p < 0.007), were found to be correlated and statistically significant in determining agri-preneurial decisions. This study has several policy propositions: the government and allied stakeholders must consider the motives that inspire potential investors in agriculture. The government must also oversee the reasons for young and old agri-preneurs leaving agri-businesses because of failure. This study underscores the need to subjectively analyze agri-preneurial inspiring factors and obstacles to performance. The contributions of agri-preneurial businesses to economic growth and poverty alleviation justify the need for a concerted effort to motivate potential investors. Another pertinent contribution of the study is highlighting the obstacles of agri-preneurs to enable the government to support and prepare responsive, innovative, and resilient agri-preneurs in South Africa. This paper recommends that starting up one’s own agri-preneurial business is a good idea for abating hunger and unemployment. © 2024 by the authors.","agri-preneurial; business; inspiring factors; obstacles; sources of idea; start-up; theory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188666357"

This study proposes a novel approach that leverages ensemble models and correlation analysis based on Landsat-8 satellite data to forecast LST and explore its environmental relationships. Time-series satellite data spanning winter and summer seasons of 2018–2019 was retrieved from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. LST, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, and evapotranspiration (ET) datasets were derived from Landsat-8 data within GEE to facilitate LST modeling. The ensemble framework combines three powerful machine learning algorithms: XG-Boost, Bagging-XG-Boost, and AdaBoost, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of LST predictions. Compared to standalone models, the proposed ensemble models demonstrated significant improvements in LST prediction accuracy. While XG-Boost and AdaBoost achieved moderate accuracies with R2 values of 0.57 and 0.60, respectively, the Bagging ensemble model surpassed them with an outstanding R2 of 0.75. Furthermore, a correlation analysis by using linear regression (LR) model explored the relationships between ET, rainfall, NDVI, and LST. The analysis revealed strong positive correlations between NDVI and ET (R2 = 0.95), while correlations between NDVI and LST (R2 = 0.31) and NDVI and rainfall (R2 = 0.47) were weaker. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of LST trends and the impact of climate change on environmental variables. Ultimately, this knowledge can inform effective sustainable decision-making in the area. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Energy; Ensemble model; GEE; LST; Machine learning; Satellite data; SDG","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185407091"

The use of human effort in online labor markets is not enough, however, as a key factor is understanding the possible interventions that market operators can leverage to incentivize human effort among their labor force. We propose that platforms could implement mechanisms such as rewards or punishments at individual or group levels to incentivize real-effort and output. We apply our interventions using a collaborative image tagging experiment—a folksonomy—and the results provide interesting insights and nonobvious consequences. On average, interventions applied at the group level outperformed interventions applied at the individual level. Punishing the group provided the most controversial incentive strategy and provided a nonobvious significant improvement in effort. Rewarding or sanctioning an individual had similar effects on average, with both treatments leading to significant increases in effort post-intervention. In contrast to predictions, sanctioning appears to have significantly motivated those that were punished. Overall, the interventions applied in our real-effort collaborative image tagging experiment had a significant impact on behavior, which provides guidance for online labor market operators and the use of incentives in the creation of labeled machine learning training datasets. © 2024 University of Minnesota.

With the introduction of Industry 4.0 and its subsequent technological tools, new functions are enabled in industrial logistics activities. Efficiency, visibility, optimization, and productivity are often mentioned as benefits of successful Industry 4.0 technology implementation in logistics activities. In this paper, the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in spare parts warehousing in the oil and gas industry is studied. Method: 133 peer-reviewed journal publications indexed in Scopus and Web of Science are analyzed in a systematic literature review. The review is structured as frequency and content analysis. Aim: As there is limited research on this specific topic, the aim is for this paper to be a theoretical foundation that assists the industry with future solutions. Results: The list of benefits of implementation gathered from the literature is comprehensive. However, the list of challenges is particularly pertinent to the oil and gas industry and indicates a strong inclination towards limited and controlled implementation of some technologies. The safety demands of the industry mean there are many limitations to implementation currently.

The emergent business environment is facing increasing scrutiny and new regulations pertaining to sustainability. Hence, manufacturing in I4.0 is expected to contribute significantly to upping the sustainability quotient of businesses. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based regime, articulated by the United Nations, provides directions for assessing business performance on the sustainability yardstick. It is therefore imperative to understand and delineate the implications of I4.0 in the attainment of specific SDGs. The current research explores extant literature on this theme along with interaction with expert focus groups, composed of practitioners and researchers. An Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach has been used to identify eight key SDGs relevant and applicable to manufacturing. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), was applied thereafter, using the Super-Decisions software to understand the relationships between the I4.0 technologies (I4.0T) and the SDGs. The final synthesized outcome from AHP prioritized eight I4.0 building blocks. Digitalization of processes and systems; additive manufacturing; big data analytics; cloud computing and artificial intelligence; and machine language were identified as the top five drivers facilitating sustainable manufacturing. Together they account for 80 percent of the sustainability effort in manufacturing. The study proposes a metric called the Technology Driven Sustainability Index (TDSI) for measuring and tracking the progress of the impact of I4.0 on sustainability in the organization's I4.0 transformation journey. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Hierarchal model; Intelligent digital technologies; Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM); Sustainability index; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185199842"

Several institutions prepare self-structured recommendations by which companies are indirectly fostered to make their operation more sustainable through reporting and to help compliance with the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) regulations. However, in the preparation period, differences can be found in the actual sustainability disclosure practices across Europe (primarily by a western–eastern European relation). To examine this issue, this study aimed to investigate if there was any variation in the reporting compliance with aspects (key performance indicators—KPIs) of three reporting guidelines (Global Reporting Initiative—G4, Financial Services Sector Disclosures—GRI; Alliance for Corporate Transparency—ACT; ISO 26000:2010—ISO) between top European and Hungarian banks according to their 2021 sustainability/ESG reports, using content analysis-based disclosure scoring. The results revealed no significant differences among the general (aspect-pooled) scores for different guidelines, while the differences were significant for each guideline between the two bank groups. In the aspect-level evaluation, the European banks had higher scores in most cases, with the Hungarian banks receiving higher scores in 4 of 49 GRI, 1 of 16 ACT, and 2 of 37 ISO aspects. Significant correlations were indicated in disclosure score values between the two bank groups, which suggested similar preferences for the aspects demonstrated; however, elaboration levels differed. These findings showed that the European and Hungarian banks could be differentiated by their sustainability disclosure patterns. The results suggest a better CSRD-level preparedness of the top European banks than of the Hungarian ones, with the latter being introduced as a model group of the region. This reflects the need for more efficient adoption of best practices by financial institutions in the eastern parts of Europe. © 2024 by the authors.","Alliance for Corporate Transparency; content analysis; CSRD; financial institutions; GRI; ISO","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188720495"

Our fine-grained data are based on the universe of phone calls made in a European country between January and July 2016. We isolate social influence from observed and latent homophily by taking advantage of the rich spatial-temporal information and the social interactions available from the longitudinal behavioral data. We find that influence stemming from phone communication is significant and persists up to four degrees of separation in the communication network. Building on this finding, we introduce a new “influence” centrality measure that captures the empirical pattern of influence decay over successive connections. A validation test shows that the average influence centrality of the adopters at the beginning of each observational period can strongly predict the number of eventual adopters and has a stronger predictive power than other prevailing centrality measures such as the eigenvector centrality and state-of-the-art measures such as diffusion centrality. Our centrality measure can be used to improve optimal seeding strategies in contexts with influence over phone calls, such as targeted or viral marketing campaigns. Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate how raising the communication probability over each connection, as well as the number of initial seeds, can significantly amplify the expected adoption in the network and raise net revenue after taking into account the cost of these interventions. © 2024 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

In modern digital workplaces, agents have different skills associated with corresponding and variable task preferences. Some are inclined to give up part of their payment to avoid unfavorable matches, and the platform manager, in turn, gains extra freedom in allocating tasks by possibly charging servers for favorable assignments. Innovative marketplaces facilitate task discretion and seek novel and beneficial implementations in the platform design. This naturally leads to the problem of exploring and optimizing the task allocation process. We introduce an innovative mechanism for task assignment in the workplace and compare it to the traditional mechanism in which task routing is solely the platform's decision. To improve the welfare of all users, agents are allowed some task discretion in exchange for a fee. In a multiserver system, a server may request flexibility and, considering the other agents' behavior, choose the costly to the platform option, which may or may not be beneficial for the platform when the agents' and the platform's preferences are misaligned. We model different working environments and server preferences via different distributions and study how the agents' preferences, task costs, and flexibility fee affect the equilibrium assignment. In every case, through pricing and offering flexibility, the platform can do at least as well as a scheme with no flexibility. An important conclusion is that pricing task discretion can often improve the agents' welfare and the labor platform's profit.  © 2023 INFORMS.","autonomy; digital marketplaces; pricing flexibility; queues; strategic servers; task discretion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187643319"

With the rise of mobile stock trading, regulators and other capital market participants are concerned that these DEPs may cause retail investors to trade in ways they otherwise would not. Using an experiment, we examine the impact of two common DEPs in mobile trading platforms- color (i.e., the use of green or red to indicate performance) and allowing investors to swipe versus click and confirm to execute trades. Drawing from prior research, we predict that the color associated with firm information will interact with how investors execute their trades to affect investment decisions. Consistent with expectations, results show that investors make the largest investment in a firm when they swipe to trade and firm information is colored green, relative to when they click and confirm to trade or firm information is colored red, holding firm economics constant. Swiping to trade causes investors to focus relatively more on the upside of investing, but only when firm information is colored green and not when it is colored red. The color red leads to a muted effect of swiping to trade as investors experience more negative affect and focus relatively more on the downside of investing.

When a supplier with a drop shipping option produces green products, more fees may be invested in the production of green products than on normal products. The drop shipping e-tailers and suppliers with a drop shipping option can also choose to sell normal products at a low cost, as before. This study designs four models of drop shipping e-tailers and suppliers with a drop shipping option under different choices, analyzes their operational process in drop shipping models, and investigates five theorems. The optimal pricing decisions and green degree of drop shipping e-tailers and suppliers with a drop shipping option were evaluated in this study. The impacts of the green innovation factor, green elasticity coefficient, manufacturing and distribution costs on the drop shipping e-tailers and suppliers with a drop shipping option, and the effect of other environmental parameters on the green degree of green products are also analyzed through computer simulation. The findings of the simulation analysis provide valuable guidance for e-tailers and suppliers with green innovation in drop shipping models and offer important academic and practical implications for e-commerce and the digital economy. © 2023 by the authors.","analysis; drop shipping; e-commerce; green innovation; green products","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188908625"

In doing so, two profitability measurements, namely, return on asset (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), have been used as dependent variables, while capital adequacy, asset management quality, operational efficiency, credit risk, liquidity, and the size of the bank have been considered as bank-specific independent variables. In addition, the rate of interest, inflation, and GDP growth rate have also been taken as macroeconomic independent variables. This study examined panel data of eight Shariah-based Islamic banks over a thirteen-year period spanning from 2010 to 2022, applying different kinds of linear regression models, including pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed effects, and random effects. Subsequently, the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach is also applied to assess the robustness of the findings. The results revealed that the profitability of Bangladeshi Shariah-based Islamic banks is positively associated with asset management quality, liquidity, and credit risk. In contrast, capital adequacy, operational efficiency, and bank size are negatively correlated with the bank’s profitability. Concerning the macroeconomic factors, the findings indicated a notable positive correlation between the profitability of Shariah-based banks in Bangladesh and both the inflation rate and the interest rate spread. However, this study has also found that the profitability of the sample banks of Bangladesh is not significantly influenced by GDP growth. By providing fresh empirical data, the current research aimed to close a significant vacuum in the body of knowledge on banks and provide important insights for policymakers, managers, and other stakeholders by focusing on particular bank-specific and macroeconomic aspects that influence the profitability of Shariah-based Islamic banks in Bangladesh. © 2024 by the authors.","determinants; economic growth; financial access; macroeconomic; profitability; Shariah-based Islamic banks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188918652"

Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected and analysed qualitative data from 26 SMEs in South-East England that have used digital technologies to pivot during the pandemic. The data was collected via in-depth semi-structured interviews. The authors analysed the data by creating first-order concepts, second-order themes, and aggregating dimensions. Findings: The findings suggest that (1) digital technologies enable pivoting by facilitating the creation of the following digital capability types: “digital sensing”, “digital seizing” and “digital transforming”; (2) Each of these digital capability types is underpinned by micro-foundations (sub-capabilities) and shaped by the digital culture of the organisation. (3) these capabilities are triggered by the turbulent environment and the existing digital technologies, and are shaped by the digital culture. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the literature of digital entrepreneurship as the authors illustrate (1) how the micro-foundations of digital capabilities, as facilitated by digital technologies, assist pivoting; and (2) the process from key activities during pivoting to second-order themes that represent micro-foundations to digital (dynamic) capabilities for pivoting in turbulent environments.

This paper conceptualizes growth hacking, a managerial-born process to embed a data-driven mind-set in marketing decision-making that combines big-data analysis and continuous learning, allowing companies to adapt their dynamic capabilities to the ever-shifting international competitive arenas. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of studies on growth hacking, this paper conceptualizes this managerial-born concept through the double theoretical lenses of IDMCs and information technology (IT) literature. Findings: The authors put forward research propositions concerning the four phases of growth hacking and the related capabilities and routines developed by companies to deal with international markets. Additional novel propositions are also developed based on the three critical dimensions of growth hacking: big data analytics, digital marketing and coding and automation. Research limitations/implications: Lack of prior conceptualization as well as the scant literature makes this study liable to some limitations. However, the propositions developed should encourage researchers to develop both empirical and theoretical studies on this managerial-born concept. Practical implications: This study develops a detailed compendium for managers who want to implement growth hacking within their companies but have failed to identify the necessary capabilities and resources. Originality/value: The study presents a theoretical approach and develops a set of propositions on a novel phenomenon, observed mainly in managerial practice.

It serves as a risk management tool, guiding various stakeholders in making decisions. While artificial intelligence (AI) has shown high success rates in classification tasks, it remains uncertain whether its use significantly enhances the potential for early warning of impending problems. The following question arises: will classical methods eventually replace the effectiveness of these advanced techniques? This paper sheds light on the fact that even classical methods continue to achieve results that are not far behind, highlighting their enduring importance in financial analysis. This paper aims to develop bankruptcy prediction models for the chemical industry in Slovakia and to compare their effectiveness. Predictions are generated using the classical logistic regression (LR) method as well as AI techniques, artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and decision trees (DTs). The analysis aims to determine which of the employed methods is the most efficient. The research sample consists of circa 600 enterprises operating in the Slovak chemical industry. The selection of eleven financial indicators used for bankruptcy prediction was grounded in prior research and existing literature. The results show that all of the explored methods yielded highly similar outcomes. Therefore, determining the clear superiority of any single method is a difficult task. This might be partially due to the potentially reduced quality of the input data. In addition to classical statistical methods employed in econometrics, there is an ongoing development of AI-based models and their hybrid forms. The following question arises: to what extent can these newer approaches enhance accuracy and effectiveness? © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; artificial neural networks; bankruptcy; decision tree; logistic regression; prediction; support vector machine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188838433"

Especially, for recommender systems and click-through rate prediction, these models have shown great predictive power. In this work, we aim to predict the probability that a customer will click on a given recommendation, given only its current session. Therefore, we propose a two-stage approach consisting of a customer behavior-embedding representation and a recurrent neural network. In the first stage, we train a self-supervised skip-gram embedding on customer activity data. The resulting embedding representation is used in the second stage to encode the customer sequences which are then used as input to the learning model. Our proposed approach diverges from the prevailing trend of utilizing extensive end-to-end models for click-through rate prediction. The experiments, which incorporate a real-world industrial use case and a widely used as well as openly available benchmark dataset, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. Our approach predicts customers’ click intention with an average F1 accuracy of 94% for the industrial use case which is one percentage point higher than the state-of-the-art baseline and an average F1 accuracy of 79% for the benchmark dataset, which outperforms the best tested state-of-the-art baseline by more than seven percentage points. The results show that, contrary to current trends in that field, large end-to-end models are not always needed. The analysis of our experiments suggests that the reason for the performance of our approach is the self-supervised pre-trained embedding of customer behavior that we use as the customer representation. © 2024 by the authors.","click-through rate prediction; customer representation; e-commerce; embedding; LSTM","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188892268"

However, it practically suffers from the difficulty of class imbalance, i.e., the number of responding (target) customers is often much smaller than that of the non-responding customers. This issue would result in a response model that is biased to the majority class, leading to the low prediction accuracy on the responding customers. In this study, we develop an Ensemble Learning with Dynamic Weighting (ELDW) approach to address the above problem. The proposed ELDW includes two stages. In the first stage, all the minority class instances are combined with different majority class instances to form a number of training subsets, and a base classifiers is trained in each subset. In the second stage, the results of the base classifiers are dynamically integrated considering two factors. The first factor is the cross entropy of neighbors in each subset, and the second factor is the feature similarity to the minority class instances. In order to evaluate the performance of ELDW, we conduct experimental studies on 10 imbalanced benchmark datasets. The results show that compared with other state-of-the-art imbalance classification algorithms, ELDW achieves higher accuracy on the minority class. Last, we apply the ELDW to a direct marketing activity of an insurance company to identify the target customers under a limited budget. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Direct marketing; Dynamic ensemble learning; Imbalance classification; Response modeling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185408640"

Accordingly, this study explores the correlation between artificial intelligence (AI) investments and corporate EF to strike a balance between economic growth and ecological products value realization. In light of the “double carbon” target constraints and economic challenges, addressing this question holds paramount theoretical and practical significance. This study primarily utilizes data from Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2021 to gauge the influence of AI on corporate EF. Results of our benchmark regression analysis reveal that a 1 percentage point increase in AI investment can lead to a corresponding 0.0228 percentage point improvement in enterprise EF. Additionally, employing the Heckman model, our study establishes that the enterprise EF data examined herein has no sample selection bias. Furthermore, no endogenous selection issues were observed within the scope of our study. Exploring the mechanisms of this relationship, our analysis demonstrates that the number of independent green patent applications and the sustainability accounting index strengthen the positive impact of AI on corporate EF.

This study uses the Moran index and the spatial Durbin model to explore the spatial correlation of ecological resilience as well as the influencing factors and presents the following conclusions. First, ecological resilience appears to be on an upward trend in time, spatially characterized by a transition from higher resilience in the east region to lower resilience in the west region. Second, spatial autocorrelation in ecological resilience exhibits a positive relationship. Most cities in Jiangxi Province are high-high agglomerative cities, while most cities in Hunan and Hubei Provinces are low-low homogeneous cities and high-low polarized cities, respectively. Third, given that population density, economic development, and financial development negatively affect ecological resilience, government green investment has a positive effect and positive spatial spillovers.

Early movers, particularly inland emitters (e.g., in continental Europe), do not yet have access to a fully developed CO2 network infrastructure connecting them with the offshore storage hubs (e.g., in the European northern seas, as these belong to the first wave of storage infrastructure that will be developed in Europe). Therefore, specific source-to-sink CCTS supply chains combining and integrating different transport options must be developed and deployed first. In this work we analyse such transport options, which include (i) tank containers that can be transported by trucks, trains, barges, or ships, (ii) dedicated tanks permanently integrated into trucks, trains, barges, or ships, and (iii) pipelines. We develop general and portable methods, criteria, and correlations to determine the cost of transport through any given connection between two nodes in a CO2 network infrastructure, using any of the modes of transport above, as a function of distance and capacity. In particular, the correlations are based on real data collected through interviews with service providers and stakeholders. Based on the associated techno-economic assessment and the consideration of additional performance indicators of a more holistic nature, we carry out a multi-criteria assessment of the different transport options. Such multi-criteria approach allows for a holistic and transparent comparative assessment of the different alternatives for a whole CCTS supply chain, as illustrated with reference to a very specific connection. © 2024 The Author(s)","CCS; CO<sub>2</sub> networks; CO<sub>2</sub> supply chains; CO<sub>2</sub> transport; Hard to abate sectors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184818383"

The data from 355 tourists who used MPS to make tourism-related payments have been collected using purposive sampling. The partial least squared structural equation modeling results suggested that perceived value, threat, controllability, and social influence affect tourists' MPS usage intention. It has been further stemmed that the tourist's intent to use MPS also recommend it to others. Nevertheless, a second study has been conducted to achieve generalizable results; additionally, the technology readiness index was integrated into the existing model as a moderator. Data has been collected again from a different group of tourists meeting the criteria, and 377 responses have been received. The results revalidated the earlier findings of study 1; moreover, results suggest that the optimism of the tourist does not play its role in encouraging them to share their experience.

The South African manufacturing sector, consisting of approximately 11,400 VAT-registered organizations, is explored in a novel approach. No prior study has analyzed the cointegrating and long-run effects of I4.0 on this sector. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is employed, accommodating both stationary and nonstationary variables without recalculating the order of integration. To address endogeneity, small sample bias, serial correlation, and heterogeneity, the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) models are estimated. Long-run relationships among variables, including manufacturing value added (MVA), I4.0, carbon dioxide emissions, Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), and inflation, are considered. Vector Autoregressive (VECM) modeling is used to establish causality relationships, while the Cumulative Dynamic Multiplier (CDM) visually illustrates impact relationships. Data from the World Bank's WDI (2023), covering the period 2000Q1–2020Q4, are employed. Key findings include a significant negative relationship between I4.0 and South Africa's MVA. Policy implications suggest substantial investments in advanced education, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), and medium to high technology exploration. The study reveals positive associations between carbon dioxide and MVA, significant short and long-run impacts of FDI on MVA, and a long-run relationship between inflation and MVA.

We test whether the resource curse hypothesis is effective for MENA nations during internal and external conflicts. The outcomes of moments quantile regression (MMQR) show that this study negates the resource curse hypothesis (NRC) because NRR supports FD in MENA countries. Internal and external conflicts impede FD; however, external conflicts show a stronger magnitude. When countries face internal and external conflicts, the resource blessing hypothesis does not hold anymore; rather, it becomes a resource curse. The negative sign of interaction terms of the NRR and internal and external conflicts capture this notion. Lastly, technological innovation facilitates FD.

As an influential financial instrument, Green Finance has gained significant traction among global policymakers for its ability to motivate businesses to actively participate in sustainable practices. This study seeks to bridge existing research gaps by examining how the implementation of Green Finance Reform and Innovation Pilot Zones (GFRI) influences corporate green investments causally. Utilizing the Difference-in-Differences identification strategy with the establishment of GFRI in 2017, our findings provide strong evidence that GFRI effectively stimulates corporate green investments. The conclusion remains robust through a series of tests. Furthermore, we investigate three potential mechanisms that may elucidate this positive impact: external financing, corporate environmental consciousness, and government attention to the environment. Specifically, GFRI imposes penalties on high-pollution enterprises (HPEs), leading to decreased access to external funding, while rewarding non-high-pollution (NHPEs) enterprises with increased access to external funding. Simultaneously, it fosters corporate awareness of environmental issues and amplifies governmental focus on the environment and the effectiveness of environmental law enforcement. Additionally, our findings suggest that GFRI's influence is more pronounced for HPEs and state-owned enterprises but less significant for companies that have already established environmental management systems.

Critics allege that these programs can stymy housing markets through lien-related risks that discourage buyers and lenders. Using data from Florida, we find support for these claims. Our analysis suggests that PACE program rollouts predict fewer home sales and weaker house price appreciation. We investigate the channel for these results and observe that mortgage lenders are less likely to approve loan applications in areas after local PACE programs are introduced.

In order to remain competitive, enterprises have responded positively to this research and development, which is conducive to the enhancement of their own digital construction. BT can provide technical support for companies to strengthen their internal management and reduce business risks caused by information asymmetry. However, the ability to reduce enterprise financial risk effectively depends on the breadth and depth of BT concerns. This study constructs word-frequency statistical variables of BT concerns based on the annual report data of listed companies. It conducts an empirical study on the issue of BT concerns affecting corporate financial risk prevention and regulation based on a propensity score matching difference-in-difference model. The results show that: (1) Attention to BT significantly reduces corporate financial risk (2) In terms of the mechanism effect, Attention to BT can significantly reduce corporate financial risk by optimizing accounts receivable management, enhancing debt servicing ability, and improving corporate performance. (3) The heterogeneity analysis shows that the concern of BT in reducing financial risk is even more significant for enterprises whose social responsibility is not effectively regulated and for hybrid enterprises.

Employing advanced methodologies, including the extension of the QVAR technique to short-term (SR), medium-term (MR), and long-term (LR) connectedness analysis, as well as the application of the CQ method to explore relationships within varying market conditions and timeframes, the study examines the interconnectedness of critical variables: artificial intelligence (AI), the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Paris Agreement (PA), green technologies (GT), geopolitical risk (GPR), and ET. The findings highlight several crucial insights. Firstly, all selected variables demonstrate substantial interconnectedness across different time horizons, except for MR, which exhibits comparatively weaker connectedness than SR and LR. Secondly, independent series reveal diverse impacts on ET across various market conditions and periods. For example, in SR, most series produce mixed effects on ET, with BRI having primarily adverse consequences and GPR predominantly yielding positive impacts. In MR, the influence of AI, PA, and GT on ET varies, while BRI enhances ET, and GPR essentially hampers it. Notably, in LR, AI, BRI, PA, and GT significantly promote ET, while GPR disrupts its progress. Additionally, the study underscores the dynamic and time-varying nature of the relationships between AI, BRI, PA, GT, GPR, and ET across different market conditions, thus holding essential implications for shaping global policies to foster sustainable energy transitions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; BRI; Energy transition; Paris Agreement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184784768"

However, there is an increasing awareness of the significant potential and growing interest in financial technology, and supportive business regulations. Hence, this study investigates the pivotal role of fintech, natural resources, and economic freedom in shaping the economic growth trajectory of the CAREC region between 2000 and 2020. So far, no publicly available fintech index exists for this region. This study constructed a comprehensive index considering digitalization and financial development to analyse fintech readiness. It applies fixed and random effect models to examine the relationships between these variables. To account for non-linearity stemming from structural shifts and global financial shocks, it employs method of moment quantile regression (MMQR). The findings from the fixed effect models substantiate the positive impact of fintech, economic freedom, and natural resources on economic growth, albeit with varying degrees of marginal influence. A one-percentage-point improvement in fintech, economic freedom, and natural resources yields economic growth boosts by 0.102%, 0.903%, and 0.176%, respectively. Parallel results emerge from the random effect models with differing magnitudes and parameter significance levels. The MMQR outcomes consistently highlight the potency of fintech and economic freedom, with their impact being more pronounced at higher and lower quantiles of economic growth, respectively. This suggests that countries in the CAREC region experiencing higher growth levels stand to gain more from Fintech adoption, while those with lower growth levels can reap greater benefits from enhanced economic freedom. This study sheds light on the multifaceted interplay of these factors, offering valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the CAREC region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","CAREC region; Economic freedom; Economic growth; Fintech; Natural resources","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186436178"

A deeper comprehension of the metaverse ecosystem is crucial to facilitate long-term planning and the dynamic adaptation of business models in the closely related e-commerce sector. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to explore how the metaverse impacts e-commerce business models. A two-round Delphi-based scenario study (time horizon 2035) was conducted with 26 participating experts to achieve the objective. Based on the expert responses, twenty projections were clustered into three possible future scenarios: (1) immersive and emotional commerce, (2) altered digital landscape, and (3) game changer. The scenarios indicate that the metaverse development will strongly influence e-commerce business models at the customer interface and core strategy. New business models will emerge, and existing business models will adopt the metaverse as an additional channel. As purely digital products gain increased importance, the digital landscape will be altered to fulfill new customer requests. Although improbable by 2035, the game-changing scenario entails a complete transition to digital products and the replacement of present e-commerce with metaverse commerce. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Business model; Clustering analysis; Delphi study; Delphi-based scenario study; e-commerce; Metaverse; Scenario study","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185802379"

The primary purpose of this study is to determine how herding affects digital purchases. It is an under-researched area in the marketing and consumer behavior context. First, one needs to understand the circumstances under which one is likely to herd. Second, it is yet to be understood how the effect of observing others' buying behavior transmits into herding. Third, there needs to be a better understanding of the role of price in one's tendency to herd. An online experiment with 541 participants was conducted using a 3 (consumer ratings/sales volume/control) × 2 (high involvement product/low involvement product) between-subjects design. LED TV was selected as a high-involvement product and ball pen pack was selected as a low-involvement product. This research study combined three theories to propose a holistic herding model. It used the social impact theory to capture its persuasive impact, the information adoption model to analyze the acceptance of herding information, and the cue utilization theory to assess the inference from herding information in consumer decision-making. Results indicated significant negative moderating effects of perceived price and product knowledge and the positive moderating effect of perceived uncertainty between the relationship of herding cues (star rating and the number of products sold) and herding behavior. In addition, the mediating results of perceived information usefulness and perceived quality were also significant. This herding model provides a holistic view of the herding process beyond limiting it to an attempt to follow others blindly. Therefore, this study has both theoretical as well as managerial implications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer herding behavior; Perceived information usefulness; Perceived price; Perceived uncertainty; Product knowledge","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185154171"

From the quantitative discussions, it is shown that there are favourable and negative impacts from AII to REI, and the positive ones indicate that artificial intelligence plays an incentive role in developing renewable energy. However, this incentive role cannot permanently be established if AII's effect on REI is negative, which is mainly caused by non-renewable energy with less costs. In turn, there is a favourable influence from REI to AII during COVID-19, highlighting that the downturn in renewable energy and stock markets caused by this epidemic impedes the progress of artificial intelligence in China.

Although there is anecdotal evidence that software patents of a focal firm can adversely affect its rival firms, there is a paucity of empirical research on such competitive impacts of software patents. In order to advance our understanding of the competitive impact of software patents, we investigate the impact of a firm's software patents on rivals’ market value using data from the US IT industries. Importantly, we consider heterogeneity across firms, in terms of their ability to successfully commercialize their patented invention, which has not been studied. Drawing upon resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capability perspective, we examine how rival firm's R&D capabilities might moderate such a competitive relationship. Furthermore, we theorize that firms must have supportive marketing and operations capabilities if they are to commercialize software patents and generate significant value. Specifically, our analysis of a large unique panel dataset of 563 IT firms in the United States during the period 2003–2012 indicates evidence of negative impacts of a focal firm's software patent stock on its rivals’ market value. However, if rivals have sufficient R&D capabilities, they can mitigate the negative impacts of the focal firm's software patents. Moreover, we find that marketing and operations capabilities indeed ensure that software patent stock has strong positive impacts on the forcal firm's market value.

This integration aims to optimize the recycling process of electric vehicle batteries, ensuring utmost efficiency. To gauge the effect of incorporating ChatGPT on participants' values, we introduce technology coefficient parameters, providing a deeper understanding of its impact. In the initial phase of the auction, a sophisticated platform or an impartial third-party appraisal firm is employed. Their task is to collect vital attribute information from potential sellers regarding the waste batteries. Subsequently, this information is carefully matched with interested buyers. To determine the appropriate number of buyers both before and after the auction, we introduce two innovative matching mechanisms. We propose the implementation of a pioneering one-sided affine VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) auction, which portrays the affine externality of buyers to other buyers, along with a weighted generalized second-price auction. Additionally, we introduce a ground-breaking mechanism known as weighted multi-unit trade reduction. This inventive process allows successful bidders from the first stage to actively participate in the subsequent auction. Within this paper, we develop auction allocation rules based on the interplay between winning sellers' supply and winning buyers' demand. The outcomes of our numerical studies demonstrate the efficacy of the two-stage auction method in addressing buyers' concerns regarding battery performance. Furthermore, we have found that the utilization of ChatGPT technology proves advantageous for both participants and the platform; if buyers have a positive affine externality on other buyers, then the platform's revenue will be reduced, while social welfare will increase. In the realm of incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balancing, our proposed mechanism stands unwaveringly strong, having undergone rigorous scrutiny and demonstrating commendable performance in numerous numerical experiments. Lastly, we offer practical management insights for stakeholders in the battery recycling market.

Meanwhile, the balance between environmental protection and economic benefits has become pivotal for firms to achieve sustainable development. As an effective means to promote green development, green innovation (GI) can provide opportunities for firms to establish a good image and gain competitive advantages. Besides, bargaining power (BP) determines the firms’ profit allocation ratio in the supply chain. Firms with higher bargaining power can pressure suppliers to improve product quality or reduce wholesale price, and thus enhance corporate profits. Given that these two variables are crucial for stimulating firms’ development in supply chains from a long-term perspective, we aim to investigate how these two variables are affected by DF and the influence mechanisms of DF on firm performance based on the data of Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2018.

First, green finance effectively enhances the quality of provincial export products. Second, green finance boosts product quality through four pathways: environmental regulation, pollution index, green total factor productivity, and technological innovation. Third, the positive impact of green finance is greater for technology-intensive products, products with high technological complexity, and digital products. Fourth, secondary indicators of green finance, including green insurance, green credit, and carbon finance, significantly influence product quality. Finally, environment regulations play a role of partial mediation whereby green finance affects export production quality in highly polluted provinces, but exhibits full mediation in lowly polluted provinces.

We argue that the recent accelerated growth of AI, especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, raises significant issues and challenges that the accounting academy needs to urgently address to survive in the long term. Developments in AI have, we suggest, created a ‘change-inducing crisis’, presenting a unique opportunity for accounting academics to address the uncritical and problematic functionalist view of the discipline and the technical reductionism of accounting. Our arguments represent a call for action to embrace AI in learning and teaching practices in a way that brings about a renewed focus on the human dimension of accounting, incorporating broader social and critical perspectives, thereby addressing longstanding calls for change in AE to move beyond the technical, managerial, and financial focus (core of the AE curriculum) that has dominated the discipline for many decades. Accounting academics have a fundamental role to play in recognising the nature of the threats and the associated challenge of AI and to seize the opportunities available in ways that bring both critique and being critical to the fore.

Thus, it is of utmost importance for South Asian countries to conceptualize environmental development policies that can be implemented to tackle carbon emission-related environmental hazards. Moreover, due to high reliance on natural resources, almost all South Asian nations find it extremely difficult to reduce their carbon discharges. Therefore, taking note of these concerning issues, this study aims to explore the environmental impacts associated with natural resource dependency, geopolitical tensions, financial development, and urbanization in the context of major South Asian countries including Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. Notably, this study emphasizes whether reducing geopolitical tensions, by resolving external conflicts, can help these nations limit the carbon emission-related problems that are specifically associated with natural resource consumption. In this regard, a composite carbon curse index is calculated using data regarding three carbon emission-based indicators of environmental quality (per capita carbon dioxide emissions, rate of carbon intensity of energy use, and per capita consumption-based carbon footprints). For analytical purposes, several advanced panel data estimation methods that are robust against cross-sectionally dependent data with heterogeneous slope coefficients and endogeneity-related issues, are employed. Overall, the results endorse that more dependence on natural resources for stimulating economic growth worsens the carbon curse faced by the South Asia nations. By contrast, reducing geopolitical tensions through the resolution of external conflicts is observed to help the selected South Asian countries limit the carbon curse associated with natural resource consumption, both directly and indirectly. Therefore, in line with these findings, relevant decarbonization policies are recommended, which the concerned South Asian governments can take note of when designing green growth policies in the future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Environmental quality; Environmental sustainability; External conflicts; Geopolitical tensions; Natural resources","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185536064"

Public value aims at enhancing the performance of government institutions services. Throughout the current research, authors have suggested a novel way to evaluate the performance and management of FSMA by theorizing a new conceptual framework entitled Public Value of Fintech Services’ Mobile Apps (PV-FSMA). A quantitative approach was chosen to measure several factors influencing the use of FSMA and evaluate the degree of public value of FSMA among Jordanians. The structural equation model was conducted based on the results of the PV-FSMA model hypotheses. The results confirmed that FSMA-intention to use (FSMA-ITU) and its predictors: FSMA-usefulness (FSMA-US), FSMA-awareness (FSMA-AR), FSMA-security (FSMA-SE), FSMA-social influence (FSMA-IS), and FSMA-system quality (FSMA-SQ) except FSMA-ease of use (FSMA-ES) are valuable determinants of PV-FSMA.

While there is a compendious literature that explores this area, surprisingly little of it makes explicit reference to the ethic-theoretical foundations upon which it is built. To address this matter, this study makes an examination of the AI ethics literature to identify its ethic-theoretical foundations. The study identifies the lack of AI ethics literature that draws upon seminal ethics works and the ensuing disconnectedness among the publications on this subject. It also uncovers numerous non-Western ethic-theoretical positions that can be adopted and may afford new insight into AI ethics research and practice. Employing these alternative lenses may obviate the tendency for Western worldviews to dominate the academic literature. The study provides some guidance for future AI ethics research which should endeavor to clearly articulate its chosen ethic-theoretical position, and for practice which could benefit from understanding and articulating the principles upon which AI systems are founded.

Successful corporate sustainability transformation requires targeted information on a firm's sustainability performance which should be provided by management accountants due to their specific expertise in gathering, analysing and presenting information. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of sustainability management accounting (SMA) is the adequate education of the next generation of management accountants. To this end, sustainability issues should also be included in management accounting textbooks, which are an important source for educators in determining the structure and the content of management accounting courses. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the extent to which management accounting textbooks deal with SMA concepts and methods to support corporate sustainability management. 33 English-language management accounting textbooks are examined applying a quantitative and a qualitative content analysis. Overall, SMA issues are dealt with mainly in a basic way, if at all. Where sustainability issues are considered, the textbooks briefly address basic concepts and definitions, selected legal requirements and standards, the integration of sustainability KPIs in balanced scorecards and environmental costing, while issues of sustainability planning and control as well as internal sustainability reporting are mostly neglected. We offer alternative explanations for a lack of curricula reform towards sustainability and propose to integrate sustainability issues into management accounting textbooks to support educators and students in teaching and acquiring the necessary SMA competencies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting education; Content analysis; Management accounting textbooks; Sustainability; Sustainability management accounting (SMA)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184921218"

The relevant findings are threefold. Firstly, the analysis of the mechanism of action demonstrates that AI can alleviate renewable energy supply chain vulnerability through technological innovation, governance system optimization, and trade network status promotion effects. Secondly, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that AI significantly alleviates renewable energy supply chain vulnerability in middle-income countries, high-vulnerability products, countries with high popularity of digital infrastructure, and countries in the initial stage of renewable energy industrial development. Thirdly, the spatial econometric results show that AI can directly alleviate domestic renewable energy supply chain vulnerability and indirectly alleviate vulnerability in neighboring countries through spatial spillover effects. This study expands the methods for identifying the impact of external environmental changes on renewable energy supply chain vulnerability. It provides an empirical reference for policymakers and professionals to maintain the security, stability, and reliability of renewable energy supply chains in the AI era. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Renewable energy; Spatial spillover effect; Supply chain vulnerability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185530190"

In the process, the impacts of financial technology, population, economic growth, trade openness, human capital, and total factor productivity on mineral productivity are examined using panel regression and panel VAR procedure for the period from 2002 to 2019. Empirical research yielded evidence indicating that increasing factor productivity and finance technology drive an increase in mineral productivity. Nonetheless, there is an inverse relationship between trade openness and mineral productivity. Moreover, there is no statistically significant relationship between economic growth, population growth, human capital accumulation, and mineral productivity. Furthermore, we also utilized with method of moments quantile regression technique to observe the effects of explanatory variables on different quantiles of mineral productivity. The findings demonstrate that although economic growth has a negative effect on mineral productivity across all quantiles, a positive increase in factor productivity has an influence on mineral productivity across all quantiles. However, financial technology and human capital accumulation only benefit mineral productivity at huge quantiles. Additionally, the outcomes of the robustness check techniques used show that financial technologies and mineral productivity have a bidirectional causal link and that, in the former instance of positive shocks in the latter, there are positive and substantial reactions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Economic growth; FinTech; Human capital; Mineral productivity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184659932"

However, the journey to harness AI for CBM is fraught with challenges as firms grapple with the lack of sophisticated processes and routines to tap into AI's potential. The fragmented literature leaves a void in understanding the barriers and development pathways for AI capabilities in CBM contexts. Bridging this gap, adopting a capabilities perspective, this review intricately brings together four pivotal capabilities: integrated intelligence capability, process automation and augmentation capability, AI infrastructure and platform capability, and ecosystem orchestration capability as drivers of AI-enabled CBM. These capabilities are vital to navigating the multi-level barriers to utilizing AI for CBM. The key contribution of the study is the synthesis of an AI-enabled CBM framework, which not only summarizes the results but also sets the stage for future explorations in this dynamic field. © 2024 The Authors","AI future research agenda; Artificial intelligence; Business model innovation; Circular business models","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182439398"

Improving research quality has been proposed as a primary objective of open science by the United Nations, to increase science reproducibility, impact, and trust, leading to robust decision-making and policies. However, opening access to data and processes is insufficient for researchers to achieve open innovation in the context of globalization, for example, by gathering insights from external and internal sources. Developing the appropriate mindset to manage complexity and generate synergy among researchers in academia, industry, and the government is essential to catalyze knowledge and transform it into relevant innovations for society. To gain insights into the roles and challenges of researchers aiming to bridge the gap between open science and open innovation, a decade-plus Mapping Literature Review was conducted based on the complex thinking paradigm. Complex thinking allows for novel connections of the information collected through open science and open innovation, considering different forms of engaging with alternative means of knowledge creation that may promote innovative and critical thinking. The findings revealed: a) broad positioning of the terms in the European Union; b) open access and open data as current driving themes; c) a constant trade-off between the terms “open data” and “information protection”; d) lack of studies on researchers’ complex thinking to help them manage openness; e) absence of the environmental helix in the initiatives; and (f) challenges in innovative communication and collaborative practices among public and private entities. Overall, we identified an opportunity to develop researchers’ complex thinking such that the openness of information becomes a shared responsibility among partners across multiple helices. This shared responsibility can have methodological implications that permeate how open science and open innovation are theorized and, in practice, facilitate the development of fundamental collaborative research procedures. © 2023 China Ordnance Society","Complex thinking; Ecosystems; Educational innovation; Higher education; Open innovation; Open science; Research enhancement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182386535"

In contrast, studies on SMEs companies, especially regarding adopting e-commerce, have not been widely conducted. So, this research is important to determine what factors drive the adoption of e-commerce and the effect on marketing performance in Palestinian SMEs. The study's theoretical foundation is based on the TOE framework with AI Integration, Innovation Culture, and Customer Tech-Savviness.

Hence, there is a need to benchmark the current state of embodied emissions attributed to the commercial built environment and the impact of circular economy (CE) policies for their decarbonization to facilitate well-informed decision-making. This paper fills this knowledge gap through providing policy makers with a framework that estimates the current and future projections of embodied carbon emissions attributable to the US commercial building stocks and highlighting the decarbonization potential of multiple CE policies. To this end, the following multistep research methodology was adopted: (1) collecting and integrating relevant data; (2) conceptualizing and initializing a system dynamics (SD) model; (3) developing subsystems and coflow structures within the SD model using aggregated stock data from the National Energy Modeling System; (4) verifying and testing the developed SD model; and finally (5) suggesting policies and conducting scenario analysis using CE policy precedents. Findings reveal that in the baseline scenario, cumulative emissions are projected to reach 5,605 MtCO2e by 2050. As for the scenario analysis, the unit size reduction policy emerged as the most impactful single policy, achieving a remarkable 38.8% decarbonization. Whereas the comprehensive CE policy that optimizes floorspace demand and the carbon intensity of materials, exhibited a 52% decarbonization potential by midcentury. As such, this study contributes to the body of knowledge by benchmarking emissions projections, providing insights regarding CE decarbonization strategies, their associated primary stakeholders and implementation pathways. Ultimately, by embracing a holistic approach toward CE policies and harnessing accurate and standardized data on building embodied emissions, stakeholders can effectively attain decarbonization goals and promote a sustainable built environment. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182734844"

For SC sustainability, efficiency, and performance improvements, the adoptation of disruptive technologies like AM plays a vital role, because the product’s SC benefits in terms of reduced total lead time and costs. Methods: To explore the state-of-the-art influences of AM on the SC in this study, 978 papers published in peer-reviewed journals from 2004 to 2023 were retrieved, and 70 of these were identified as the most relevant and then reviewed. Results: As an outcome, the results of this review paper indicated a lack of documented studies in developing countries and, as a result, limited research works, for instance, in fashion industries were observed. In addition, AM best practices in the SC context have been identified and categorized as cost-related, time-related, inventor-related, as well as energy-, waste-, and environment-related factors, SC efficiency factors, and flexibility, marketing, and manufacturing-related factors. Conclusions: By identifying these categories, the study aims to contribute to the efforts of transforming traditional manufacturing into AM-based processes, for which a framework for the AM SC implementation is developed. In summary, the systematic review indicated that further research work is needed on the impacts of the identified AM best practices on SC performance. © 2024 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; best practices; disruptive technologies; supply chain; supply chain management; sustainability","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184008774"

Here we discuss the respective limitations of vignette studies (affective forecasting errors, biased media coverage, and question substitution) and case studies (social desirability biases and lack of random assignment and control conditions), which may lead them to overrate negative and positive reactions to AI management, respectively. We further discuss the advantages of a third method for mitigating these limitations: field experiments on crowdsourced marketplaces. A proof-of-concept study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk; as a world-leading crowdsourcing platform) showed unique human reactions to AI management, which were not perfectly aligned with those in vignette or case studies. Participants (N = 504) did not differ significantly under AI versus human management, in terms of performance, intrinsic motivation, fairness perception, and commitment.

Many perspectives – societal, engineering, research, management and policymaking – have been extensively analysed in an attempt to understand the role of the different stakeholders in minimising risks and amplifying opportunities. Interestingly, however, the investment community has been scarcely studied, despite the critical role of financing in technology innovation. This paper attempts to characterize investors' perceptions around the concept of digital innovation governance. We present insights derived from qualitative research using constructivist grounded theory, based on a series of interviews to 23 venture capital investment managers. Analysis of the data collected suggests several categories of important factors regarding how venture capital managers engage in Digital Innovation Governance (DIG): legitimacy of involvement, opportunity of conducting and capability to lead DIG initiatives in the invested startups. We offer a structured inventory of venture capital manager insights and perceptions on innovation governance. According to our research, venture capital managers, and investors in general, find themselves capable of and see opportunities and relevance in effectively fostering a digital innovation governance that takes into account the potential risks of Artificial Intelligence and identifies business and societal opportunities. © 2024 The Authors","AI ethics; AI governance; Digital governance; Digital innovation; ESG","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182259793"

Understanding how digital transformation and alliance management capability can work together to enhance supply chain capabilities during a crisis is important. We have developed a theoretical framework that explains how the alliance management capability, under the mediating influence of digital transformation, helps build supply chain capabilities for unprecedented crises. This framework highlights key enablers such as alliance management capability, digital transformation, supply chain agility, and supply chain adaptability that are essential for organisational performance. We tested our theoretical model using a survey of 157 individuals working in the manufacturing industry in India. Our findings suggest that combining alliance management capability and digital transformation enhances supply chain capabilities, which improves an organisation's ability to respond to crises. Moreover, digital transformation, supply chain agility, and adaptability are critical determinants of organisational performance during crises. Therefore, companies that use digital technologies to increase their agility and adaptability are more likely to perform well during times of crisis. To collect qualitative data, we interviewed key participants (n = 27) and identified four key enablers for a digital transformation strategy for supply chains: coordination, digital leadership, digital culture, and digital talent management.

Among the most important applications of AI technology, industrial robots are increasingly being used in production and have become significant feature of high-quality ecinomic development. Concerning this issue, this study uses the provincial panel data from China from 2010 to 2019 to explore how adopting industrial robots affects regional pollution emissions. We find that industrial robots significantly reduce the pollution emissions intensity in various provinces of China, and this conclusion holds following a series of robustness tests. Mechanism analysis shows that industrial robots reduce pollutant emissions intensity by improving energy efficiency and enhancing pollution reduction technologies. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that industrial robots significantly reduce pollution emissions intensity in the eastern and western regions of China, as well as in regions outside the Yangtze River Economic Belt, while this effect is significant for the central region and the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Industrial robots primarily promote pollution reduction in the eastern region, rather than enhancing regional energy efficiency. For the western region and regions outside the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the reduction in pollution emissions intensity appears to be attributable to both mechanisms. The above findings enrich the study on the impact of industrial robots on green production behavior and provide insights into pollution emissions control for some provinces of China. © 2024","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence (AI) technology; Energy efficiency; Industrial robots; Pollution emissions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184010677"

This paper aims to explore the mechanism of digital transformation stages on corporate internal management. Using data of Chinese listed companies for the years 2008 to 2020, this paper finds that digital transformation can significantly improve internal control quality. Specifically, at the development stage of enterprise digital transformation, the positive impact of digital transformation on internal control becomes apparent. In the maturity stage, digital transformation can improve five components of internal control. The heterogeneity analysis finds that when the company is state-owned, high-tech, located in the central and western, and located in the provinces with low marketization, the effect of digital transformation on internal control is stronger. Extended analysis finds that the digital transformation of enterprises can further contribute to improvements in financial performance and total factor productivity. The findings are of significant value for companies to apply digital technologies in depth to promote digital transformation and achieve high-quality internal control.

The strategic use of platform envelopment is determined by the tradeoff between the benefits of sharing existing users and inconvenience of using the embedded platform. This study investigates when the pure envelopment strategy (PES), mixed envelopment strategy (MES), or no envelopment strategy (NES) should be adopted and examines several coordination schemes for the platforms. A centralized decision-making case and a decentralized decision-making case are first formulated and compared. The results show that NES is the only equilibrium solution under a decentralized decision-making case and the cooperation between the two platforms can lead to higher profit of both platforms by adopting the PES or the MES. We then propose a partial equity ownership (PEO) contract, a proportional fee (PF) contract, and a fixed fee (FF) contract to coordinate the system, benefiting both platforms. The PES or the MES may be the equilibrium strategy under a PEO contract, whereas the MES is the only equilibrium strategy under a PF or an FF contract. This study finds that the adoption of a PEO contract will lead to higher surplus of consumers and providers, and social welfare. In addition, we find that only PEO contract may perfectly coordinate platforms to achieve the same total profit as that under the centralized decision-making case, while PF and FF contracts cannot. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Game theory; Hassle cost; Network effects; Platform envelopment; Two-sided platform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183944803"

This indicates considerable challenges in resource management amid geopolitical instability. We also find that the role of different types of reserves varies, with gold serving as a safe haven and financial and other reserves being used to meet immediate economic needs. Additionally, the role of natural resources like oil emerges as an alternative revenue stream in geopolitically risky contexts. Our findings underscore the necessity for flexible and robust economic policies to mitigate the impacts of geopolitical risks on national reserves and resource management. © 2024","Financial reserve; Geopolitical risks; Gold reserves; Oil reserve","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184064246"

Exploiting a field survey of fresh agricultural products from smallholder farmers in rural China, we empirically show that the high temperatures driven-supply risks can be mitigated by sales channel adjustment from offline to online and thus increase producers' agricultural profit. One percentage point increase in online channel sales driven by high temperature raises farmers' unit profit growth by 1.12 CNY. In the absence of sales channel adjustment, farmers’ agricultural economic losses due to high temperatures could be up to 26.65% higher. These findings are significant not only because high temperature events are predicted to increase significantly in the future, but also because they shed light on how smallholder farmers with limited adaptability to extreme weather can better adapt to adverse conditions by supply chain management - thus prospering rural e-commerce and development. © 2024","E-commerce; Extreme weather; Fresh product; Sales channel; Supply chain management; Temperature","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183204198"

Previous literature has emphasized that quality products can be produced effectively and will provide better customer service if product redesign is performed considering the broad OEM-supplier(s) ecosystem. To this end, we seek to develop a mathematical model focused on maximizing the objectives of the OEM-supplier(s) ecosystem considering a centralized supply chain in such a manner that operational-level financial objectives are mapped in terms of product line design decisions and attribute-level assignments. By including operational-level supply chain considerations such as service levels and consumers' preferences, we seek to capture key aspects related to customers’ requirements. This research links product-level technical decisions with enterprise-level business objectives, thus bridging engineering and enterprise-level financial nuances. The problem for the manufacturer pertains to the minimization of the manufacturing cost and maximization of the product premium. The problem for the suppliers pertains to maximization of salvage value, minimization of shortage cost, and maximization of sales revenue. These two problems are then sewed together, and a chemical reaction optimization (CRO) based solution methodology has been deployed. To solve and analyze the devised problem, a case study based on an industrial consumer product is conducted. We evolve a comprehensive mathematical framework that mimics the facets related to product line redesign encapsulating considerations pertaining to functional level design, supply chain dimensions, and manufacturer-supplier profitability. Several novel findings are reported based on the study. For instance, we demonstrate that product configurations for respective segments after the redesign process are contingent upon the service level. Further, we demonstrate that in the industrial consumer product market, higher profit for the OEM-supplier(s) ecosystem is achieved at a slightly lower service level as opposed to a higher theoretical service level. The study has important implications for design and product management. © 2024","Chemical reaction optimization; Industrial product; Optimization; Product line redesign; Stochastic demand","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183118934"

In response, this study pioneers an innovative approach to identify and evaluate sustainable mineral development projects in China. This study employs a structured approach, integrating the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)-Grey methods, to identify essential criteria, sub-criteria, and prioritize Financial Technology (FinTech) strategies conducive to responsible mineral development. In the study, the through literature review were conducted to identify the key criteria, sub-criteria, and strategies for the analysis. The Fuzzy AHP analysis assesses six main criteria to represent a holistic framework for evaluating mineral projects. Within these criteria, specific sub-criteria are identified as focal points. The subsequent TOPSIS-Grey analysis ranks FinTech strategies based on their effectiveness in promoting sustainable mineral development. The findings of Fuzzy AHP method showed that Financial Viability, Regulatory Compliance, and Technological Innovation are the key criteria. Besides, the TOPSIS-Grey approach indicated that Blockchain Technology emerges as the preeminent strategy, followed by Supply Chain Finance Platforms and Carbon Credit Trading. These strategies include strengthening transparency, financial mechanism as well as environmental responsibility using technology in developing minerals.

Specifically, we contend that experiential knowledge stimulates investment in emerging technologies based on the absorptive capacity perspective. Meanwhile, drawing on the competency trap perspective, we also argue that experiential knowledge may discourage investment in emerging technologies. Empirical evidence from blockchain-related funding rounds reveals that experiential knowledge negatively influences investment in emerging technologies, which is consistent with the competency trap perspective. We also discover that investor reputation and investor status exacerbate the competency trap implications.

Four case studies highlight the challenges of utilising diagnostic AI tools at differing stages in their innovation journey. Two ‘upstream’ cases seeking to demonstrate the practical applicability of AI and two ‘downstream’ cases focusing on the roll out and scaling of more established applications. We observed an unfolding uncoordinated process of social learning capturing two key moments: i) experiments to create and establish the clinical potential of AI tools; and, ii) attempts to verify their dependability in clinical settings while extending their scale and scope. Health professionals critically appraise tool performance, relying on them selectively where their results can be demonstrably trusted, in a de facto model of responsible use. We note a shift from procuring stand-alone solutions to deploying suites of AI tools through platforms to facilitate adoption and reduce the costs of procurement, implementation and evaluation which impede the viability of stand-alone solutions. New conceptual frameworks and methodological strategies are needed to address the rapid evolution of AI tools as they move from research settings and are deployed in real-world care across multiple settings. We observe how, in this process of deployment, AI tools become ‘domesticated’.

Based on China's energy-consuming rights trading (ECRT), the study to examine its effect on firms' green total factor productivity (FGTFP) at the micro level is lacking. Meanwhile, it is also worth exploring what new opportunities the rapid development of the digital economy brings to ECRT. In this paper, we adopt the super-efficient EBM-GML model to measure FGTFP. On this basis, we assess the impact of ECRT on FGTFP by matching the data of A-share listed firms in China and provincial data from 2010 to 2019 while exploring the moderating effect of the digital economy. We reveal that ECRT significantly boosts FGTFP. This finding is supported by the synthetic control method, PSM-DID, the dual machine learning method, and other robustness testing methods. The mechanism analysis confirms that ECRT improves FGTFP mainly through three channels: promoting firms' green technological innovation, resolving firms' excess capacity, and alleviating firms' financial resource mismatch. The moderating effect emphasizes that the digital economy strengthens the contribution of ECRT to FGTFP. In addition, through heterogeneity analysis, we observe that the green development effect of ECRT is more prominent in the samples of state-owned enterprises, high energy-consuming firms, and firms with higher relocation costs. Meanwhile, we uncover that the positive moderating effect of the digital economy needs to be supported by the higher intensity of intellectual property protection and the level of digital infrastructure development in the region.

However, it may also inevitably lead to issues such as widening the digital divide between urban and rural areas, which can impact the extent to which rural residents effectively benefit from the digital economy. This study employs provincial panel data from 2011 to 2020 and conducts a temporal global principal component analysis to measure the level of China's digital economy development. Based on this, the spatial Durbin model is employed for empirical testing and regional analysis of the impact and mechanisms of digital economy development on the per capita disposable income of rural residents. The partial linear function coefficient model is used for supplementary analysis. The results indicate the following: (1) there are regional disparities in China's digital economy development, with the highest levels in the eastern region, followed by the western region and the lowest levels in the central region, forming a U-shaped spatial structure; (2) the development of the digital economy has a suppressing effect on the per capita disposable income of rural residents in both the home province and neighbouring provinces, indicating that the digital economy has not become a growth booster for rural revitalisation; (3) regional results show that the negative spatial effects of the digital economy are in the eastern region, whereas the western region has considerable positive spatial spillover effects. In contrast, no notable spatial effects exist in the central region. Therefore, under the backdrop of the digital economy, it is necessary to promote agricultural transformation and increase rural residents’ income by tailoring strategies to regional characteristics. © 2024 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland","Digital economy; Income of rural residents; Spatial econometrics; Spatial effects","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182551803"

Should firms take advantage of such an opportunity, or should they rather charge all consumers the same price (uniform pricing)? It might seem obvious that it is optimal for an individual firm to use personalized pricing; if it does, it can charge each consumer a price equal to her maximal willingness to pay. No other price plan can possibly yield higher profits. However, we show that if a firm is expected to use personalized pricing, then it effectively eliminates a rival's possibility to select values on non-price variables, such as horizontal differentiation, that can soften competition and increase profits for all firms. Once we take this into account, we might no longer expect that personalized pricing is a dominant strategy. Indeed, we show that it may be a dominant strategy for a firm to commit to uniform pricing prior to the rival's choice of non-price variables if it has the ability to do so. © 2024 The Author(s)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184021415"

The findings reveal that a 1% increase in ICT development correlates with a short-term rise of nearly 0.18% and a long-term increase of 0.23% in the volume of mineral resource trade. This outcome underscores the diverse impact of digitalization, contributing to improved communication, efficiency, and global connectivity. Interestingly, the pursuit of green growth initially leads to a reduction in mineral resource trade volume, decreasing by 0.08% in the short term and 0.19% in the long term, indicative of a shift toward sustainability. A 1% increase in GDP significantly stimulates mineral resource trade, resulting in a 0.21% increase in the short term and a 0.45% increase in the long term, while a stronger official exchange rate has a positive effect on trade. Conversely, heightened country risk exerts a diminishing influence on trade. In order to advance sustainable mineral resource trade, OECD nations are encouraged to prioritize green growth initiatives, invest in sustainable power generation, implement measures for economic stability, manage exchange rates effectively, and promote responsible corporate practices. © 2024","Digital transformation; Green economic growth; ICT development; Mineral resource trade; OECD; Pooled mean group method","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183999935"

This study aims to identify the paradoxical tensions that exist among companies in digital servitization ecosystems as well as unravel their interrelationships. To address these objectives, we apply a multi-method approach. First, a systematic review of the literature reveals 16 paradoxical tensions arising from inter-firm collaboration. Next, based on interviews with academic and industry experts, we assess the relationships among these tensions. In particular, we focus on the perspective of technology providers due to their importance in delivering smart solutions. Finally, we apply Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and fuzzy Matrices d'Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliqué a un Classement (MICMAC) to the experts' responses to define the interrelationships between the identified tensions and cluster them based on their driving and dependence power. We adopt a paradox theory lens to classify the identified tensions into four categories—i.e., learning, belonging, organizing, and performing—and provide a conceptual framework showing their cause-and-effect relationships. We reveal that paradoxical tensions in digital servitization ecosystems do not exist in isolation; rather, they are interconnected.

This study discusses a functional characteristic of business models that academia still needs to address. It explores new frontiers in the field, such as business models for networks, sustainability, and their practical evaluation. To achieve an integrative ontology and avoid focusing on specific constructs or systems at the expense of others, we draw upon the theory of worldviews from Wilhelm Dilthey, reformational philosophy, and Herman Dooyeweerd’s theory of modal aspects. Society should move beyond dualistic thinking and embrace practical and applicable solutions. To help companies develop effective models, we introduce a new business model framework based on an integrative worldview that enables comparisons and evaluations of companies in practice.

Due to this limitation, it could be challenging for construction management scholars to understand the advances made in the realm of construction ethics, grasp a holistic understanding, and chart future research. Therefore, our study aims to examine ethical discourse in construction comprehensively. This study uses a mixed-method literature review (MMLR), combining bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review. We analyzed 328 articles published between 1990 and 2023. First, through a bibliometric analysis conducted on the data sets obtained from Scopus and Web of Science, we identified publication trends, influential authors, prolific journals, impactful institutions, and countries in the field of construction ethics. Second, through a systematic literature review of 125 journal articles, we mapped the qualitative aspects of ethical discourse in construction. The meticulous review process elucidated the critical theoretical paradigms (economics, institutional, strategic stakeholder management, psychology, sociology, and ethics), emerging research themes (culture, corruption, professional development, welfare, leadership, technology, compliance, environment, social and governance (ESG), practices, project procurement, and stakeholder), and prominent analytical approaches used to study ethics-related issues in construction. The present study also mapped the ethical discourse on a multilevel (macro, meso, and micro) ethical governance framework and explored the geographical contexts and spread of ethics and ethical discourse. Finally, we presented potential future research trajectories by employing the theory-characteristics-context-methods (TCCM) framework that could encourage scholarly investigation in this domain. Practical Applications This review study provides several implications for research scholars and practitioners in the construction sector. This study provides fertile grounds for construction management scholars to begin by exploring the theoretical paradigms that are the foundation for research. Researchers should carefully select research methodologies to explore the ethical issues. This research highlights the most influential articles, authors, countries, institutions, and journals, helping the researchers explore the opportunities to collaborate with these entities. The paper has significant implications for various stakeholders, including construction companies, regulatory bodies, workers, clients, and broader society. It has highlighted the key thematic areas that help shed light on the multidimensional nature of ethics in the construction sector and encourage construction companies to adopt responsible practices. This can enhance the industry's reputation and credibility, making it more attractive to investors and clients. We also discussed the ethical governance framework at the macro, meso, and micro levels that will help the stakeholders understand various aspects of ethical compliance across these levels within the construction industry. Further to chart the future research directions, we employed the TCCM (theory, context, characteristics, methods) framework with which the construction management practitioners and researchers may broaden their understanding of construction ethics. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Bibliometric analysis; Construction; Corruption; Ethics; Systematic literature review","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182733021"

This research uses a three-step process. First, a review of reviews is conducted to search the variables that would positively influence adoption of blockchain in supply chain. In the second step, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) was utilized to understand the relationships among the enablers. Following the qualitative phase, an empirical study was conducted to test the hypotheses related to the mediating role of coopetition. Review of reviews identified 17 variables that can positively influence blockchain adoption in supply chain. The findings of TISM model revealed the hierarchical relationship among the enablers of blockchain adoption for supply chain management based on their relative importance. The results of the SEM-based study indicated that ‘coopetition’ plays a mediating role between the driver and dependent variables leading to sustainable supply chain. The research offers practical insights to integrate blockchain application in the supply chains leading to better supply chain transparency and ultimately sustainability. The research would support managers to develop suitable strategies to strengthen mechanism to enhance coopetition among competing supply chain to realize the benefits of emerging technologies. The originality of the study lies in the study of variables that influence blockchain adoption in supply chain using a mixed-method approach.

Employing social network analysis, PageRank, and Superedge Rank methodologies, this investigation evaluates how TikTok users—called TikTokers—address climate change and its impact on social media. The assessment scrutinizes climate-related news, disasters, and the resultant networks to gauge the influence wielded by social influencers in disseminating messages. Results reveal that among the four key entities—internet influencers, government, scientists, and producers—internet influencers exert the most substantial influence on climate change news dissemination on TikTok, while the government plays an influential role in climate disasters. Like other social media platforms, TikTok is a valuable arena for gauging public sentiment on critical health concerns like global warming.

Meanwhile, online shopping and unconventional promotions have also changed individual lifestyles. While the world is demanding broader actions against climate change, how and to what extent the digital transformation of modern society can affect consumption and its associated emissions is an important but uncertain question to address. This paper takes China as an example and explores households' digital activities and consumption behaviors from a nationwide survey. As a result, we demonstrate that wider digital adoption was overwhelmed by larger embedded carbon emissions, mainly from consuming larger scale of non-basis goods and generating indirect carbon emissions. Although the overall association between digital adoption and the household carbon emissions was positive, this article finds that digital adoption indeed promoted pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors which further declined the emissions. Likewise, city's digital development declined the positive impact of digital adoption on the household direct emissions. Furthermore, empirical results show that social network, social trust and local satisfaction played significant roles in leading lower household carbon emissions in the digital era. Thus, this study has important policy implications for China's commitment to carbon neutrality in 2060 from demand side. © 2024","China; Consumer lifestyles; Digitalization; Embedded carbon emissions; Household consumption","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182282990"

AI-based emotion analytics from speech is a promising technological option to provide helpful analyses for online business meetings, but might be perceived as scary as emotions are a sensitive topic. However, employees' acceptance of such a type of software is not understood properly yet as there are no offers on the market yet. To investigate potential users' intentions, we conducted a survey in 2021 as well as in 2023 with data from 470 employees in Germany with regard to a novel type of software analyzing emotions from speech on a group level in virtual meetings. We argue that employees' decision of acceptance bases on balancing different pros and cons for sticking with an existing behavior or using an emotion analytics software. A partial least squares (PLS) approach to structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the study's hypotheses. Our results show that attitude, perceived norms, perceived efficacy and perceived threats are significant predictors for the intention to accept such a software. At the same time, privacy concerns were only in 2023 a reason to reject the software.

However, ChatGPT is still less common in the financial sector than in other industries. This study attempts to understand bankers' perceptions towards using ChatGPT. Towards this, the study employed an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach. Eventually, 10 bank professionals participated in the preliminary semi-structured interviews to gain insight into their perceptions. Sequentially, the study cross-sectionally examined the identified factors among 368 bankers to triangulate the framework with empirical evidence. The Thematic Content Analysis (TCA) analysis identified seven new factors related to bankers' use of ChatGPT, which were primarily validated in PLS-SEM assessments. The results showed the positive effect of performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, awareness, innovativeness, and system quality on ChatGPT usage and the negative effect of technology self-efficacy and IT features. Intriguingly, the moderating effects of central bank support were positively confirmed for innovativeness and social influence, but negative for the relationship between technology self-efficacy, awareness, and bankers' intention. This study offers a highly predictive model contemplating the applicability of an extended UTAUT model to explain the use of ChatGPT in the banking sector.

Despite Sweden's advanced digitalization efforts and the widespread application of AI in the public sector, our study reveals significant gaps between theoretical ambitions and practical outcomes, particularly in the context of AI's trustworthiness. We employ a robust theoretical framework comprising Institutional Theory, the Resource-Based View (RBV), and Ambidexterity Theory, to analyze the challenges and discrepancies in AI implementation within PES. Our analysis shows that while AI promises enhanced decision-making efficiency, the reality is marred by issues of transparency, interpretability, and stakeholder engagement. The opacity of the neural network used by the agency to assess jobseekers’ need for support and the lack of comprehensive technical understanding among PES management contribute to the challenges in achieving transparent and interpretable AI systems. Economic pressures for efficiency often overshadow the need for ethical considerations and stakeholder involvement, leading to decisions that may not be in the best interest of jobseekers. We propose recommendations for enhancing AI's trustworthiness in public services, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, particularly involving jobseekers in the decision-making process. Our study advocates for a more nuanced balance between the use of advanced AI technologies and the leveraging of internal resources such as skilled personnel and organizational knowledge. We also highlight the need for improved AI literacy among both management and personnel to effectively navigate AI's integration into public decision-making processes. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on trustworthy AI, offering a detailed case study that bridges the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application.

Notwithstanding, there is a lack of enthusiasm and interest in adopting and using electric vehicles in Africa. EV acceptance and proliferation hinge pivotally on consumer attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors. This underscores the need to inquire about the adoption intention of electric vehicles in Africa. Empirical studies on the adoption of EVs in Africa remain limited. Consequently, the study investigates EV adoption intention in Ghana, – a crude oil-endowed African nation. The study expanded the technology acceptance model (TAM) with imposition perception, low-carbon commuting campaigns, and status symbolism. With 512 responses, a structural equation model (SEM) was applied in verifying the hypothetical statements. Attitude, perceived ease of use, and status symbolism positively influenced EV adoption intention, as imposition perception showed an adverse impact. Low-carbon commuting campaign was insignificant in impacting EV adoption intention. Status symbolism insignificantly impacted attitude. Perceived-ease-of-use impacted attitude. Attitude fully mediated low carbon commuting campaigns and EV adoption intention. The analysis also indicated that perceived-ease-of-use partially mediated the impact of imposition perception and status symbol on EV adoption intention. Policy initiatives are enumerated for improving EV adoption and proliferation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Electric mobility; Electric vehicles; Environmental sustainability; Low carbon commuting; Structural equation model; Technology acceptance model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182449062"

This suggests that increased natural resource abundance correlates with decreased environmental degradation. Other important relationships we discover point to the beneficial role of digitalization in reducing environmental harm, while urbanization appears to intensify it. Based on our empirical results, policymakers should prioritize strategies that discourage the overexploitation of natural resources, foster digitalization, and advocate for sustainable urbanization practices to mitigate environmental damage.

Among these efforts, the regulations like GDPR are the most influential, which are believed to be able to change the foundation of the whole data ecosystem. The main concern of current regulation is data transparency, designed to enable individuals to make rational decisions about their data. However, I argue that transparency cannot mitigate a key issue of data privacy, which is the right of receiving benefits from data. This issue is getting severe with the rapid development of the data economy and will become the essential problem of social welfare and fairness in the AI era. I further point out that the key to solving this issue is to migrate the current centralized data utilization paradigm to a new decentralized paradigm.

These issues are well understood in the European Union (EU), which promotes sustainable development of its economy, for which innovativeness and digitalization are of vital importance. The paper addresses this issue by presenting the results of a study of the level of innovativeness and digitalization of enterprises in the countries of the EU. The objectives of the research were to assess the level of innovativeness and digitalization of enterprises in the EU-27 states and to determine a relationship between digitalization and the level of innovativeness of these enterprises, as well as the impact of selected economic, energy, social and environmental parameters on these processes. The importance and interaction of these areas, as well as their impact on the economy, causes the methodology developed and the research conducted to consider both these dimensions of business activity simultaneously. To achieve these goals, an original research methodology was developed. Its basis was a set of 18 selected indicators characterizing the state of digitalization and innovativeness of enterprises in the EU-27 member states. Three methods of Multiple-criteria decision-making (EDAS, MOORA, VIKOR) and the Hurwicz criterion were used for the primary research. On the other hand, the CRITIC, Entropy and equal weights methods and the Laplace criterion were used to determine the weights of indicators. The multi-criteria approach to the issue under study made it possible to achieve the set objectives and formulate conclusions and answers to the research questions posed. The results unequivocally indicate a link between the innovativeness of enterprises and the process of their digitalization and R&D expenditures in the EU countries. The level of innovativeness and digitalization is definitely higher in the group of the so-called ""old EU-14' states than in the “new EU-13” states. The research and its results provide ample opportunities for conclusions as to the state of both studied processes (digitalization and innovativeness) in the enterprises of the EU-27 states. The wide scope of the research carried out makes it possible to use the findings to build strategies and future economic policies of the entire EU and individual countries. The universality of the developed methodology also gives a wide range of possibilities for its application for further research. © 2024 The Authors","Companies; Decision-making criteria; Digitalization; EU countries; Innovativeness; MCDM methods","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183551207"

However, this approach neglects an in-depth examination of the specific and novel aspects of DT that have contributed to its failures. Additionally, we propose key recommendations for shaping future research agendas in this domain. © 2024 The Authors","Bibliometrics Analysis; Digital Transformation; Failure; Information System; Organisation Transformation; People Transformation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183476516"

This can potentially reshape the interdependencies and interactions of complex systems, leading to our research question: To what extent and in which direction is the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and System Dynamics (SD) converging within the business and management landscape? We conducted an extensive literature review using bibliometric and topic modeling methods to address this question. Through a bibliometric analysis, we identified the areas in which academic papers referred to both SD and AI literature. However, bibliometrics do not show a clear path towards convergence. The top modeling analysis highlights more details on how convergence is structured, providing insights into how SD and AI may be integrated. Two trajectories are identified. In the “soft convergence,” AI supports system dynamics analysis and modeling more deeply characterized by social interaction. In the “hard convergence,” AI shapes innovative ways of rethinking system design, dynamics, and interdependencies. Our analysis suggests that while soft convergence is more visible in the business and management landscape, hard convergence may well represent a new frontier in studying system dynamics with the potential to reshape the landscape. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Bibliometrics; Forecasting; System dynamics; Technology; Topic modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182901027"

Within the framework of the construal level theory, we examine the moderating role of the platforms (social media vs. online shopping websites) on the suggested eWOM message → perceived credibility → perceived diagnosticity → eWOM effect relationship. The results from a randomized online experiment with a sample of 316 participants (Mean age = 29.44, SD = 8.94, Range = [18, 70], 219 females) reveal that for readers of eWOM on social media, feasibility-oriented eWOM has a greater effect than desirability-oriented eWOM; while for readers of eWOM on online shopping websites, there is no significant difference between the impacts of the two types of eWOM messages. These findings provide support for the moderating effect of platforms on this relationship. Specifically, the effect of feasibility-oriented eWOM is more pronounced for readers on social media compared to that on online shopping websites, whereas the effect of desirability-oriented eWOM is similar for readers on online shopping websites and social media. These findings have implications for marketing strategies involving eWOM and offer insights into the effects of platforms, construal level theory, and the Elaboration Likelihood Model of information adoption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Construal level theory; Electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM); Information adoption model; Online shopping websites; Social media; Social networking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184056782"

So this study assesses the effect of technological innovations on poverty reduction using a panel of 36 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2008 to 2019. More specifically, the study examines the influence of technological innovation on poverty reduction. Using the principal component analysis (PCA) we constructed an indicator of the use, adoption and adaptation of technological innovations and that of multidimensional poverty. After applying several estimation techniques for panel data such as fixed effects, Driscoll and Kraay, kiviet (2020), Lewbel two stage least square (Lewbel 2SLS), mediating effects, the results shows that technological innovations significantly reduce poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results survive several robustness checks. Taking into account the level of urbanization, it appears that technological innovations reduce poverty in countries with low urbanisation rates and increase it in countries with high urbanization rates. Finally, the analysis of mediation effects suggests that almost 30 % of the total effect of the use, adoption and adaptation of technological innovations on multidimensional poverty reduction is through the improvement of productivity in the industrial sector while 62.5 % is through the productivity of the agricultural sector. These results imply that poverty reduction policies in sub-Saharan Africa need to refocus on capacity building in the use, adoption and adaptation of technological innovations, particularly in the agricultural and industrial sectors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural sector productivity; Artificial intelligence; Digital economy; Industrial sector productivity; Multidimensional poverty; Technological innovation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183207931"

However, very few platforms have a truly global footprint given that factors such as competition, imitation, innovation, and cultural and political barriers hamper a digital platform's international growth path. The geographical scope of network effects plays a crucial role in this process, impacting users at various levels from the local to the global. We model the dynamics of international platform competition and predict its outcomes in terms of global potential market percentage through a simulation of the international growth of a two-sided platform in competition with two follower platforms in different locations (home/abroad) and different internationalization strategies (gradual/accelerated), and operating under different network effects (local/global). The model contemplates different delays in the launching of the rival platforms and different degrees of innovation (improvement) in comparison with the original platform. Our findings highlight the crucial role of network effects, with global effects benefiting first movers and local effects favoring followers, especially if they start in a market different from the first mover's. Moreover, domestic followers must innovate, while followers in less competitive markets with local network effects have more options to increase potential market percentage, including launching a clone. These insights offer valuable suggestions for strategy development and regulatory considerations related to market share, market power, and international expansion. © 2024 The Authors","Digital platforms; Innovation; Internationalization strategies; Network effects; Simulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183022729"

They are also seeking fashionable modest clothing, yet, despite their growing buying power, the US modest fashion market targeting Muslim women appears underserved. The purpose of this study was to critically examine how niche modest fashion brands in the United States target Muslim women while drawing upon theoretical concepts centring on oppression and agency related to the long history of gendered Islamophobia Muslims have experienced. We analysed eleven brands’ websites and social media applying the constant comparative method and identified four themes: empowering Muslim women, reclaiming modesty as modern and beautiful, meeting fashionable modest wear demand, and rejecting and perpetuating colourism. In our analysis of the digital discourses of US modest fashion brands, we revealed that these brands emerged to meet the demand of young Muslim woman in the United States who are embracing the hijab and modest clothing as a potent symbol of resistance against western ideologies, the fashion system’s oppressive acts towards Muslim women and traditional Islamic dress codes. Yet, their advocacy-centred messages – empowerment, reclaiming modesty as beautiful – operate within a profit-driven system, which we theorize as a fashion-advocacy-capitalistic-façade. The fashion-advocacy-capitalist-façade concept helps explain the slippery slope that fashion brands are tiptoeing as they aim to empower Muslim women, offer trendy modest clothing, reject traditional Islamic dress codes for women and create space in the fashion market for this unmet demand. Although these brands aim to promote a positive sense of self for Muslim women, they cannot be withheld from critical examination and potential interpretations when operating within the capitalist-driven industry that is so often plagued with significant injustices. © 2024 Intellect Ltd Article.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became apparent that care robots enable increased social isolation. This feature of robotic care usually raises strong ethical concerns about potentially decreased comfort for the care-dependent. In a large-scale online study, we tested the influence of the pandemic on people's affective attitudes toward care robots. In vignettes on different care scenarios, we measured participants' perceived comfort levels in situations with care robots and human caregivers while controlling for their fear of infection with a viral disease. We found that people generally feel less comfortable with a care robot than with a human caregiver. However, those who had a strong fear of being infected during the pandemic did not devalue a care robot compared to a human caregiver. While care robots remain ethically contested, this study shows that affective attitudes toward care robots may change significantly if they can address an urgent need. © 2024 The Authors","Affective attitudes; Care robots; COVID-19 pandemic; Vignette experiment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182724973"

This paper utilizes panel data from Chinese A-share listed industrial enterprises from 2009 to 2021 and employs time-varying difference-in-differences (time-varying DID) model to investigate the correlation between digital infrastructure and the enterprise green transformation (EGT). Empirical research indicates that the implementation of the “Broadband China” strategy (BCS) significantly propels EGT. However, its impact is not significant in the long term. Mechanism analysis reveals that the BCS fosters EGT by stimulating green technology innovation (GTI) and alleviating financing constraints (FC). The analysis of supply chain spillover effects reveals that the implementation of the BCS can stimulate the green transformation of downstream enterprises within the supply chain. However, its impact on upstream enterprises is not significant. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the BCS exerts a more significant effect on the green transformation of enterprises in non-heavily polluting industries, enterprises in the growth stage, and enterprises located in regions with lenient environmental regulations. This paper provides innovative insights for realizing the EGT in theory and offers empirical evidence for the improvement and promotion of the BCS in practice. © 2024","Digital infrastructure; Financing constraints; Green transformation; Supply chain; “Broadband China” strategy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182889131"
